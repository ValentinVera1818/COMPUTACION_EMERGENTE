However, existing TG methods, particularly unconditional diffusion models, struggle with spatiotemporal fidelity as they often overlook some travel patterns that are critical in an individual's mobility behavior, such as recurrent location visits, movement scope, and temporal regularities. In this work, we propose the Autoregressive Diffusion Model for Travel-Pattern Aware Trajectory Generation (Traveller), a novel approach that integrates autoregressive travel-pattern modeling (AR-TempPlan) with diffusion-based trajectory generation (TravCond-Diff) to produce realistic and context-aware movement patterns. By leveraging the spatial anchor and temporal modes of visiting different locations, we derive an individual's particular travel pattern as spatiotemporal constraints for guided trajectory generation. Building on this, AR-TempPlan generates a mask location sequence as the temporal modes, planning location transitions over time, while TravCond-Diff leverages this planning signal and home location, the spatial anchor, to guide spatial generation through a discrete diffusion process. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Traveller with the dual guidance mechanism enables the production of high-fidelity and individual trajectories that effectively capture complex human mobility behaviors while preserving privacy.

This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of deep learning advances in remote sensing STF over the past decade. We establish a systematic taxonomy of deep learning architectures including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and sequence models, revealing significant growth in deep learning adoption for STF tasks. Our analysis reveals that CNN-based methods dominate spatial feature extraction, while Transformer architectures show superior performance in capturing long-range temporal dependencies. GAN and diffusion models demonstrate exceptional capability in detail reconstruction, substantially outperforming traditional methods in structural similarity and spectral fidelity. Through comprehensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets comparing ten representative methods, we validate these findings and quantify the performance trade-offs between different approaches. We identify five critical challenges: time-space conflicts, limited generalization across datasets, computational efficiency for large-scale processing, multi-source heterogeneous fusion, and insufficient benchmark diversity. The survey highlights promising opportunities in foundation models, hybrid architectures, and self-supervised learning approaches that could address current limitations and enable multimodal applications.

A deep learning based approach is important in the context of crime prediction, where the goal is not only to identify potential crime patterns but also to proactively reduce crime rates and deter illegal activities. In this paper, a Rotation Invariant Co-ordinate Convolutional Neural Network based Crime Prediction utilizing Jarrett-Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (RICCNN-CP-JBOA) is proposed. Here, the input data are taken from crime dataset. The collected data are fed into the preprocessing stage using Sub Adaptive Two-stage Unscented Kalman Filtering (STSUKF) to clean the data by handling the missing values. The Random Quantum Circuits Transform (RQCT) is used to extract dynamic features and Parrot Optimization (PO) is employed to select the six features. The feature selection outputs are given into the Rotation Invariant Coordinate Convolutional Neural Network (RICCNN) to do categorical crimes predictions. The Jarrett-Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (JBOA) is implemented for optimizing the RICCNN parameters. The RICCNN-CP-JBOA technique is implemented and its efficacy is estimated using performance metrics, like Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, F1-score, ROC. The experimental results prove that the RICCNN-CP-JBOA approach attains 29.27%, 22.14% and 19.21% higher accuracy, 23.26%, 13.32% and 19.12% higher precision, 28.26%, 15.22% and 27.27% greater F1-score when compared to the existing models. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive two-stage unscented kalman filter; Jarrett-butterfly optimization; Parrot optimization; Random quantum circuits transform; Rotation invariant co-ordinate convolutional neural network","Computer crime; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crime; Data handling; Deep learning; Forecasting; Kalman filters; Optimization; Adaptive two-stage unscented kalman filter; Convolutional neural network; Jarrett-butterfly optimization; Optimisations; Parrot optimization; Quantum circuit; Random quantum circuit transform; Rotation invariant; Rotation invariant co-ordinate convolutional neural network; Unscented Kalman Filter; Rotation","","","Elsevier Ltd","09574174","","ESAPE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009509145"

While previous studies have analyzed UVP using street view imagery (SVI) but largely overlooked its spatiotemporal evolution and inequalities within walkable travel ranges. This study introduces a novel methodological framework using Hong Kong as a case study to analyze UVP changes from 2011 to 2021. We first identify static and dynamic UVP distributions, then explore spatial patterns across urban forms, housing types, and travel distances, and finally examine links between UVP changes and socioeconomic factors. The findings show that while Hong Kong's overall UVP levels remained stable, significant spatiotemporal disparities emerged. Public housing policies improved UVP for some disadvantaged groups, but low-income private housing areas in Old Town faced poorer visual environments with lower greenery levels. Socioeconomic factors, including education and income, significantly influenced UVP transitions, with elderly and ethnic minority populations experiencing greater environmental inequalities.

Within this framework, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are critical to mitigate the impact of cybercrimes and safeguarding systems from various malicious attacks. However, traditional machine learning (ML) approaches have ceased to be sufficient to handle the complexities of large-scale and unstructured data, particularly in Internet of Things (IoT) environments. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid DL-based IDS that leverages the synergistic strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gated recurrent units (GRU). While CNNs excel at extracting spatial features from network traffic data, GRUs effectively model temporal dependencies, making their combination particularly well-suited for detecting dynamic and complex IoT intrusions. In this study, we evaluate three DL models including CNN, GRU, and a hybrid CNN-GRU approach on two recent Netflow-based datasets, NF-UNSW-NB15 and NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018 for binary classification. Extensive experiments using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, False Alarm Rate (FAR), AUC, and processing time metrics show that the CNN-GRU model outperforms standalone CNN and GRU models, as well as existing literature approaches, achieving an accuracy of 98.60% on the NF-UNSW-NB15 dataset and 97.95% on the NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset. Our findings underscore the efficacy of combining spatial and temporal DL architectures for robust IoT intrusion detection, offering a scalable solution for modern cyber threats. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CNN; DL; GRU; IDS; IoT; Netflow-based dataset; RNN","Classification (of information); Complex networks; Computer crime; Convolutional neural networks; Crime; Cybersecurity; Deep learning; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Network intrusion; Network security; Convolutional neural network; Cyber-attacks; DL; Gated recurrent unit; Intrusion Detection Systems; Netflow-based dataset; NetFlows; Organizational network; Organizational system; RNN; Internet of things","This research was funded by Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University Researchers Supporting Project number (PNURSP2025R125), Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","16871499; 16871472","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014599812"

However, previous studies have rarely considered the green exposure experienced through human mobility, especially within the framework of the 15-minute city. Additionally, due to the lack of seasonal and large-scale spatial data, seasonal variations in green exposure have often been overlooked. In this study, we propose an assessment framework for seasonal green space exposure inequality within the context of the 15-minute city. By integrating the Green View Index, spatial statistical methods, deep learning, and publicly available urban housing price big data, we analyzed green exposure inequality in Xi’an, China. The results indicate that: (1) There is a seasonal inequality in the exposure to greenery within the 15-minute residential areas of Xi’an. At short distances (5–10 min), green exposure in summer is higher than that in winter, whereas at longer distances (15–30 min), green exposure in winter exceeds that in summer. (2) There is an inequitable relationship between urban housing prices and seasonal green exposure. In short-distance living circles, housing prices are negatively correlated with seasonal differences in green exposure, meaning that areas with less seasonal variation tend to have higher housing prices. In long-distance living circles, the correlation is positive, with areas exhibiting greater seasonal variation tending to have higher housing prices. (3) Spatial autocorrelation between housing prices and seasonal green exposure varies across different living circles, showing an unequal distribution. High-value clusters extend from the southern part of Weiyang District along a northwest-southeast axis, forming a stable pattern in the west, a dynamic pattern in the east, and a heterogeneous pattern in the central region. This study not only fills a research gap regarding seasonal green exposure at the community level but also provides new perspectives for urban planning and environmental design, offering scientific evidence to mitigate urban environmental inequalities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","15-minute city; Environmental justice; Green exposure; Housing prices; Inequality","China; city; economics; housing; human; season; socioeconomics; Cities; Housing; Humans; Seasons; Socioeconomic Factors","","","Nature Research","20452322","","","40750666","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012484582"

First, accident data exhibits twofold imbalances: (i) a class imbalance between accident occurrence and non-occurrence, and (ii) a spatial distribution imbalance among different regions. Second, sporadic traffic accidents result in sparse supervised signals, limiting the spatial–temporal representations of conventional deep models. Lastly, the Gaussian assumption underlying the previous deterministic deep learning models is unsuitable for accident risk data characterized by dispersed and many zeros. To address these challenges, we propose an Uncertainty-aware spatial–temporal multi-view hypergraph contrastive learning framework for Traffic accident risk prediction (TarU). This framework not only jointly captures local geographical spatial–temporal and global semantic dependencies from different views, but also parameterizes the probabilistic distribution of accident risk to quantify uncertainty. Particularly, a hypergraph-enhanced network and an auxiliary contrastive learning architecture are designed to enhance self-discrimination among regions. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TarU. The proposed framework may also be a paradigm for addressing spatial–temporal data mining tasks with sparse labels. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Multi-source data fusion; Spatial–temporal data; Traffic accident prediction; Uncertainty quantification","Deep learning; Gaussian distribution; Highway accidents; Normal distribution; Supervised learning; Accident prediction; Accident risks; Hyper graph; Multi-source data fusion; Multi-Sources; Source data; Spatial-temporal data; Traffic accident prediction; Uncertainty; Uncertainty quantifications; Contrastive Learning","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62476247 , 62073295 and 62072409 , in part by the \u201CPioneer\u201D and \u201CLeading Goose\u201D R&D Program of Zhejiang under Grant 2024C01214 , and in part by the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China under Grant LR21F020003 .","","Elsevier B.V.","15662535","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007090763"

Despite substantial advancements in this field, some key challenges remain. First, the traffic state of a lane segment exhibits dynamic, nonlinear spatial correlation with other segments, making accurate modeling complex in real-world environments. Second, existing deep learning models depend heavily on specific datasets, leading to poor generalization. Third, while recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit superior performance in generating reliable traffic prediction results, their direct application is hindered by inefficiency, high computational costs, and difficulties in capturing dynamic traffic features. To address these challenges, we propose the Knowledge-informed Dynamic Correlation Modeling (KIDCM) framework, which integrates pre-trained LLMs with traditional predictive methodologies to achieve a balance between generalization and prediction accuracy. Specifically, we introduce a General Spatial Dynamics Modeling (GSDM) method, which leverages the unbiased traffic data generated by LLM to analyze the general law dynamic spatial correlations. By integrating traditional time-series models with attention mechanisms, GSDM effectively models both linear temporal dependencies and nonlinear spatial interactions, ensuring robust generalization across varying conditions. Additionally, we develop a surrogate model that distills the traffic prediction function of LLMs. This surrogate model can be fine-tuned with small sample sizes, preserving the generalization advantages of LLMs while mitigating their typically high resource demands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of generalization, small-sample training, and computational cost. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic spatial correlation; Knowledge-informed model; Large language model; Surrogate model; Traffic flow prediction","Emergency traffic control; High occupancy vehicle lanes; Knowledge acquisition; Dynamic spatial; Dynamic spatial correlation; Generalisation; Knowledge-informed model; Language model; Large language model; Spatial correlations; Surrogate modeling; Traffic flow prediction; Traffic prediction; Highway administration","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62372384 ) and in part by Suzhou Science and Technology Development Planning Program, China (Grant No. ZXL2024342 ).","","Elsevier B.V.","15662535","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006813129"

By learning general features from spatio-temporal graphs, pre-trained graph models can capture hidden semantic information in the data, thereby enhancing the learning effect of downstream tasks and improving overall model performance. However, most existing spatio-temporal graph learning methods use the entire graph for training, which may not fully capture local structure and feature information. In addition, existing methods usually adopt sequence modeling techniques without fully considering the time decay effect, i.e., the need to apply decaying attention to distant time steps. To address these issues, this paper proposes a unified dual-phase multi-subgraph pre-training spatio-temporal graph framework (UMSST). Specifically, in the first phase, the framework learns the global representation of the spatio-temporal graph and locates key graph nodes, while learning the “unit representations” of these key nodes. In the second phase, multiple spatio-temporal subgraphs are constructed based on these “unit representations” to further capture the implicit encoding information of more general features around the corresponding subgraphs, thereby helping the model make full use of general features. Experimental results on real datasets show that the proposed pre-trained spatio-temporal graph framework significantly improves the performance of downstream tasks and demonstrates its effectiveness in comparison with recent strong baseline models. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Graph neural network; Multi-subgraphs; Pre-training; Spatio-temporal graph; Time decay","Graph neural networks; Graph structures; Learning systems; Spatio-temporal data; Down-stream; Graph framework; Multi-subgraph; Pre-training; Spatio-temporal dependencies; Spatio-temporal graphs; Subgraphs; Time decay; Training framework; Flow graphs","","","Elsevier B.V.","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105016460384"

Additionally, the significant variability in anomalies compared to normal actions complicates precise detection. Current state-of-the-art methods typically process all frames captured by surveillance cameras using resource-intensive, centralized systems, resulting in high computational costs and network bandwidth usage unsuitable for real-time, edge-based Artificial Intelligence of Things environments. Moreover, unclear anomaly definitions and computationally demanding real-time analyses hinder effective monitoring. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient Artificial Intelligence of Things-based anomaly detection framework employing a two-phase approach. Initially, a lightweight neural architecture search network classifies events as normal or anomalous directly on edge devices. When an anomaly is detected, the edge device alerts relevant authorities and transmits the relevant video frames to the cloud for further evaluation. In the second phase, a next-generation convolutional neural network extracts spatial features, refined by Spatial Attention Modules and further processed using a transformer-based multi-head attention network to capture contextual relationships. A Multi-Scale Feature module then classifies the anomalies into specific types. Extensive experiments conducted on the University of Central Florida Crime, Large-scale Anomaly Detection-2000, and Real-world Fighting-2000 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves accuracy of 53.60%, 80.02%, and 94.05%, with improvements of 1.8%, 1.2%, and 0.8%, respectively.

However, recent studies show that these IDS are often ineffective against adversarial attacks. Therefore, in this study, we examine latent-space vulnerabilities in variational autoencoder (VAE)-based IDS by proposing an adversarial feature generation method, which manipulates the reconstructions of VAE and misclassifies intrusions as normal activity. By perturbing inputs to match latent representations with benign distributions, we demonstrate that VAEs are susceptible to evasion rates of 96% for Decision Tree (DT) and 100% for SVM classifiers, outperforming GAN-based attacks by 15% on a simulated fluid-catalytic cracking (FCC) dataset. Statistical validation using Wilcoxon test (p<0.001) confirms that normalization processes linearly degrade reconstruction fidelity, exposing predictable adversarial dynamics.

However, security incidents such as fraud and hacking have become primary obstacles to the healthy development of blockchain. Despite the admirable designs of numerous existing blockchain platforms, which prioritize anonymity for transactional privacy, the ever-expanding scale of transaction data poses challenges to the feasibility and effectiveness of current regulatory approaches. In this paper, we examine blockchain transactions, treating them as graph data, and present a framework dubbed BTGuard, with the primary objective of exposing anomalies in anonymous transactions. Specifically, we extract hierarchical k-hop node features from the transaction graph to train an ensemble model of graph attention networks (GATs), which provides richer contextual information. An online knowledge distillation method is then seamlessly integrated into the training pipeline to facilitate mutual learning by passing soft labels among the GATs, thus building the underlying GAT into a powerful anomaly detection model and eliminating the use of sophisticated network architectures. Furthermore, a community detection technique is employed to meticulously analyze the propagation paths and associated nodes of detected anomalous transactions, facilitating penetrating transaction regulation.

However, existing KT models often overlook the diverse knowledge absorption and forgetting patterns that unfold over multiple time scales, limiting their ability to reflect real cognitive processes. According to cognitive development theory, knowledge undergoes accumulative and structural evolutions simultaneously during the learning process. To address these challenges, we propose the novel multi-scale convolutional attention knowledge tracing (MCAKT) method that integrates both the temporal and structural features of interaction sequences. Specifically, we utilize memory networks with adding and forgetting gates to create an initial knowledge state. Subsequently, we design a structural evolution module that forms a spatiotemporal graph for knowledge representation by applying aggregation operations to simulate spatial dependencies.

However, existing solutions struggle with two key challenges: (1) crime periodicity heterogeneity, where different types of crimes exhibit distinct periodic patterns; and (2) lacking of post-hoc explainability, as the black-box effect of deep neural models makes it challenging to interpret the model performance. To respond to these concerns, we present EX-Crime, a novel solution for crime prediction with an inherently explainable view. By following the merits of information bottleneck (IB) principles, we introduce an augmented graph information bottleneck learning block that is coupled with an integrated crime pattern modeling to capture spatial–temporal patterns of crimes. Moreover, a new crime type-aware periodicity learning, employing Fast Fourier Transform and autocorrelation techniques, is proposed to identify the periodic patterns of distinct crime for enhanced temporal modeling. Our extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that EX-Crime gains substantial improvements in prediction accuracy and interpretability, uncovering its potential to significantly advance crime understanding across diverse urban settings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crime prediction; Graph information bottleneck; Type-aware periodicity heterogeneity","Autocorrelation; Crime; Forecasting; Augmented graph; Black boxes; Crime prediction; Graph information; Graph information bottleneck; Information bottleneck; Periodic pattern; Public safety; Resources allocation; Type-aware periodicity heterogeneity; Fast Fourier transforms","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62072077), the Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province, China (Grant No. 2023NSFSC1411), the Sichuan Science and Technology Program, China (Grant No. 2023ZYD0145).","","Elsevier Ltd","03064573","008031418X; 0080323723; 9780080323725","IPMAD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008894202"

Precisely, the addressed network model comprises multiple cyber attacks, which entail both deception attacks (DA) and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, with an application to multi-image encryption using space-filling curves (SFC). A novel Halanay inequality involving proportional delays is established to investigate the polynomial stability of CRDINNs under a novel dual event triggered Markov-switched control (DETMC), which selects appropriate neurons as pinning nodes and applies feedback input. This method addresses derivation process issues and significantly improves control efficiency. Additionally, a novel Lyapunov function (LF) is constructed to capture system state information and manage challenges from reaction–diffusion terms, with sufficient conditions for synchronization derived through inequality techniques. The proposed pathway for achieving GPPS in systems like CRDINNs through DETMC is validated with easily verifiable linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) in MATLAB, demonstrating synchronization criteria through numerical examples under DoS and DA. Furthermore, enhanced security in image encryption schemes is achieved using efficient scrambling techniques, combining enhanced Zig zag and Raster pattern scrambling with diffusion methods. The integration of chaotic sequences from CRDINNs with permutation-diffusion schemes via DETMC leads to the development of a new image encryption algorithm, which is rigorously evaluated using various statistical metrics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dual event triggered Markov-switched control; Image encryption; Multiple cyber attacks; Reaction diffusion inertial neural networks; Synchronization","Computer crime; Cryptography; Diffusion; Linear matrix inequalities; Lyapunov functions; Markov processes; MATLAB; Network security; Neural networks; Polynomials; Robustness (control systems); Coupled reaction; Cyber-attacks; Dual event triggered markov-switched control; Event-triggered; Images encryptions; Multiple cybe attack; Neural-networks; Reaction diffusion inertial neural network; Reaction-Diffusion; Switched control; Synchronization","This research is funded by the Committee of Science of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Republic of Kazakhstan Grant No. BR24993094 and by the Nazarbayev University under Faculty-development competitive research grants program for 2024\u20132026 Grant No. 040225FD4736.","","Elsevier B.V.","10075704","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008176782"

The signals carried within CAN messages contain specific data defined by the application layer and can be manipulated by attackers to execute intrusions. However, most current intrusion detection methods focus on frame-level detection, failing to explore complex relationships among CAN signals. Since signal assignments can offset each other, the absence of signal-level detection leads to a high false positive rate and makes it challenging to trace the source of intrusive signals. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel signal-relationship-aware intrusion detection method based on Graph Transformers. The main idea of this approach is to transform CAN messages into a dynamic multivariate signal series, leveraging graph neural networks (GNN) to model relationships among signals, where signal node features are employed to learn the graph structure. To capture the global dependencies of signal features, a temporal Transformer-based supervised learning model is introduced to learn node embeddings extracted by the GNN. Additionally, this method can identify components related to the intrusion source, demonstrating strong interpretability. This method has been validated using two real in-vehicle CAN datasets including the Car-Hacking Dataset and our self-collected CAN-Injection Dataset from a real vehicle. Experimental results indicate that our approach achieved 100 % precision, recall, and F1-score for intrusion detection across all attack types, surpassing six state-of-the-art methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CAN bus; Graph structure learning; Intrusion detection system; Signal-level explainability; Transformer","Authentication; Computer crime; Control system synthesis; Controllers; Electric transformers; Graph neural networks; Graph structures; Graphic methods; Network intrusion; Network security; Controller-area network; Controller-area-network bus; Graph structure learning; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion-Detection; Signal level; Signal-level explainability; Structure-learning; Transformer; Intrusion detection","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (Grants 52202494 , 52202495 ).","","Elsevier B.V.","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013496918"

Today, certain locations provide various levels of autonomy. Constrained environments, such as airports and golf clubs, may allow fully autonomous driving (AD). Meanwhile, many public roads have started providing Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) capabilities, enabling AVs with driver intervention (DI). Yet, for future scenarios without DI, low-latency technologies, robust protocols, and secure communication mechanisms will be essential. However, dependence on computer algorithms introduces security concerns. A breach in an AV can result in serious injuries or even death.

The rapid increase in traffic data, along with the inherently dynamic characteristics of urban traffic, poses considerable challenges for traditional Machine Learning (ML) models, which often find it difficult to efficiently handle large-scale datasets. Although Deep Learning (DL) models demonstrate potential, their significant computational requirements and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting limit their effectiveness in dynamic and real-time contexts, including traffic emergencies or evolving road networks. To address these challenges, this research presents an innovative framework known as the Continual Learning-based Spatial–Temporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (STGNN-CL) for persistent and accurate long-term traffic flow prediction. By utilizing techniques such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), and Synaptic Intelligence (SI), the proposed model effectively addresses the issue of catastrophic forgetting while simultaneously enhancing its capacity to incrementally assimilate new traffic data streams. An advanced traffic pattern fusion strategy is introduced, utilizing the Kullback–Leibler Divergence (KLD) metric to measure traffic divergence across different scenarios. This approach improves the efficiency of the Continual Learning (CL) process by enabling the model to adapt to new traffic patterns more effectively over time. Extensive experiments conducted on the PeMSD3, PeMSD4, PeMSD7, and PeMSD8 datasets reveal the superiority of the proposed models, STGCN-EWC, STGCN-MAS, and STGCN-SI models achieve significant reductions in error rates compared to baseline methodologies. These results highlight the potential of continual learning in developing efficient, scalable, and adaptive traffic flow prediction systems, paving the way for advancements in transportation management and autonomous driving technologies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Continual Learning; Deep Learning; Graph Neural Network; Smart cities; Traffic prediction","","Open access funding provided by The Science, Technology & Innovation Funding Authority (STDF) in cooperation with The Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB).","","Springer International Publishing","21994536; 21986053","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013793143"

For this purpose, an Improved LinkNet-DenseNet (ILN-DN) architecture-based abnormal human activity detection model is introduced in this work, which includes 4 working stages. The novelty of the work lies in the integration of advanced segmentation techniques, enhanced feature extraction methods, and a hybrid classification model for abnormal human activity detection. Additionally, the introduction of a modified optimization algorithm significantly improves convergence speed and detection accuracy. In the pre-processing stage, median filtering is applied to get the pre-processed image (frame), after converting the input video into frames. Afterwards, that pre-processed image gets segmented by the Improved Mask R-CNN model. From the segmented image, features such as Mobile-Based Scale Invariant Feature Transform (MoBSIFT), Improved Shape Local Binary Texture (SLBT), and Hierarchy of Skeleton are extracted. Finally, based on the extracted features, abnormal human activity is detected effectively, with the utilization of a proposed hybrid classification model namely Improved LinkNet-DenseNet (ILN-DN) architecture. The DenseNet architecture is chosen for its efficient feature reuse through dense connections, which enhances the model’s ability to learn complex patterns and improve performance in detecting subtle anomalies. LinkNet, known for its strong segmentation capabilities, is utilized to precisely isolate regions of interest, such as human figures, from the background. Combining both architectures in the ILN-DN model leverages DenseNet’s deep feature extraction and LinkNet’s segmentation precision, making it highly effective for abnormal human activity detection in video surveillance. The parameters of these classifiers are fine-tuned with the utilization of the Improved Red Panda Optimization (IRPO) algorithm, to enhance the detection performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abnormal human activity detection; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Optimization algorithms; Segmentation","Architecture; Classification (of information); Computer architecture; Deep learning; Extraction; Image enhancement; Learning algorithms; Median filters; Optimization; Textures; Video recording; Abnormal human activity detection; Classification models; Features extraction; Human-activity detection; Hybrid classification; LinkNet; Optimization algorithms; Segmentation; Video surveillance; Feature extraction; Image segmentation","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","18631703; 18631711","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009738443"

Can this extend to machine learning? This article examines the effectiveness of using Moran Eigenvectors as additional spatial features in machine learning models. We generate synthetic datasets with known processes involving spatially varying and nonlinear effects across two different geometries. Moran Eigenvectors calculated from different spatial weights matrices, with and without a priori eigenvector selection, are tested. We assess the performance of popular machine learning models, including Random Forests, LightGBM, XGBoost, and TabNet, and benchmark their accuracies in terms of cross-validated (Formula presented.) values against models that use only coordinates as features. We also extract coefficients and functions from the models using GeoShapley and compare them with the true processes. The results show that machine learning models using only location coordinates achieve better accuracies than eigenvector-based approaches across various experiments and datasets. Furthermore, we discuss that while these findings are relevant for spatial processes that exhibit positive spatial autocorrelation, they do not necessarily apply when modeling network autocorrelation and cases with negative spatial autocorrelation, where Moran Eigenvectors would still be useful. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","GeoAI; GeoShapley; Moran Eigenvector","artificial intelligence; benchmarking; data set; machine learning; spatiotemporal analysis; statistical analysis","","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","00167363; 15384632","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005269581"

When some informative keyjoints are unavailable or disturbed, it can compromise the efficiency and effectiveness of existing methods. This article proposes a skeleton-based model for activity recognition to deal with the occlusion problem. The main approach of the proposed model is to address occlusion by treating it as a missing value imputation problem within the feature matrix. First, it extracts features such as normalized joints, relative joint coordinates, angles, and velocity using a CNN-based technique and encodes the skeleton data into a feature matrix. The innovative use of generative adversarial imputation networks (GAIN) with bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), enhanced by spatial and temporal attention mechanisms, effectively handled missing data due to occlusions, ensuring a complete feature matrix for subsequent classification. Additionally, this article introduces autoencoder-based Bi-LSTM with attention modules that improve activity classification by capturing and leveraging spatial and temporal dependencies. A comprehensive experiment was conducted on both occluded and unoccluded datasets to validate the effectiveness and improvements of the proposed model. Comparative results show that the proposed model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior recognition accuracy in an occluded environment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Activity recognition; bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM); generative adversarial imputation network (GAIN); OpenPose; partial occlusion","CCD cameras; Deep learning; Generative adversarial networks; Image enhancement; Speech analysis; Activity recognition; Bidirectional long short-term memory; Feature matrices; Generative adversarial imputation network; Human skeleton; Openpose; Partial occlusions; Performance; Short term memory; Surveillance cameras; Musculoskeletal system","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2329924X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004774117"

Its black-box (sub-symbolic) nature allows AI to compute prediction without explaining the rationale to the end user, resulting in lack of transparency between human and machine. Concerns are growing over the opacity of such complex AI models, particularly deep learning architectures. To address this concern, explainability is of paramount importance, which has triggered the emergence of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) as a vital research area. XAI is aimed at enhancing transparency, trust, and accountability of AI models. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of XAI from the dual perspectives of challenges and opportunities. We analyze the foundational concepts, definitions, terminologies, and taxonomy of XAI methods. We then review several application domains of XAI. Special attention is given to various challenges of XAI, such as no universal definition, trade-off between accuracy and interpretability, and lack of standardized evaluation metrics. We conclude by outlining the future research directions of human-centric design, interactive explanation, and standardized evaluation frameworks.

However, conventional surveillance methods struggle with detecting abnormal human activities in complex environments characterized by varying lighting conditions and diverse appearances of individuals. To address these challenges, we propose advanced computer vision techniques, particularly supervised anomaly detection, to enhance intelligent surveillance systems. This research introduces SilentFrm to optimize anomaly detection by analyzing frame differences and setting thresholds based on calculated areas. SilentFrm streamlines the keyframe selection process, enhancing efficiency and reducing redundancy in anomaly detection tasks. Additionally, we present XAI-Inv3, an innovative architecture that integrates interpretability techniques such as Grad-CAM and guided backpropagation into the InceptionV3 model. These methodologies exhibit high accuracy and provide interpretable insights, thereby enhancing situational awareness and security. Rigorous experimentation showcases SilentFrm and XAI-Inv3′s superior detection accuracy and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art methods. By leveraging insights from weak supervision and semi-supervised learning, our approach aims to develop robust anomaly detection models capable of discerning anomalies with precision and efficiency in dynamic surveillance environments. Integrating XAI-Inv3 with the keyframes approach facilitates real-time anomaly detection and ensures scalability and feasibility across large-scale surveillance deployments. The proposed model achieved an average accuracy of 99 % on Hockey Fight, Violent Flow and Real-Life Violence Situation datasets for violence detection and 92 % for violence recognition using UCF-Crime and Shanghai Tech datasets.

Therefore, they need to constantly monitor vast amounts of incoming and outgoing transactions. Given the involvement of many parties in money laundering, graph analytics is vital for effective monitoring. A particular challenge in detecting money laundering is that money launderers continuously adapt their tactics to evade detection. Hence, detection methods need constant fine-tuning. Traditional machine learning models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning the model on new data, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dynamic environments. Continual learning addresses this issue and enhances current anti-money laundering (AML) practices by allowing models to incorporate new information while retaining prior knowledge. Research on continual graph learning for AML, however, is still scarce. In this review, we critically evaluate state-of-the-art continual graph learning approaches for AML applications. We categorize methods into replay-based, regularization-based, and architecture-based strategies within the graph neural network (GNN) framework, and we provide in-depth experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world AML data sets that showcase the effect of the different hyperparameters. Our analysis demonstrates that continual learning improves model adaptability and robustness in the face of extreme class imbalances and evolving fraud patterns. Finally, we outline key challenges and propose directions for future research.

Existing methods show good performance in capturing the temporal dependence of MTS, but they fail to capture the correlation between Different sEnsors at Different Timestamps (DEDT). Meanwhile, most methods ignore the frequency-domain information of the time variables, limiting the model’s capability. To overcome the above challenges, we propose the MH-TFFN model, a novel architecture integrating selective state spaces with adaptive hypergraph learning, which achieves spatio-temporal relationship modeling of multivariate time series through time-frequency dual-channel learning mode and three breakthroughs. First, a weight sharing Mamba (WSMamba) network replaces conventional sequential processing with state-space-guided feature extraction, operating simultaneously on raw time sequences and their frequency representations obtained through Fourier decomposition. Second, an adaptive hypergraph constructor dynamically establishes DEDT relationships through sliding-window correlation analysis, subsequently processed by our time-frequency hypergraph neural network (TFHGNN), which preserves both topological and time-frequency characteristics. Third, a contrastive learning mechanism employs time-frequency adversarial pairs enforces feature consistency across domains, using a novel InfoNCE-based contrastive loss to optimize the joint space. The results of the experiment demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods across five MTS datasets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contrastive learning; Hypergraph neural network; Mamba; Multivariate time series classification; Time-frequency domain","","This work was partly supported by the Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Intellectual Property and Big Data (2018B030322016), Key Discipline Research Capacity Improvement Project of Guangdong Province (2022ZDJS013, 2024ZDJS022), Laboratory Management Project of Guangdong Polytechnic Normal University (2023SYS005).","","Springer International Publishing","21994536; 21986053","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010477144"

In this study, we introduce TraffiCoT-R, a prompt-based method that models the spatio-temporal relationships efficiently with LLMs. TraffiCoT-R integrates Spatio-Temporal Feature Importance Rotation (ST-FIR), a feature selection method, with a Feature Definition Module to enable contextualized reasoning and a multi-step iteration framework to enhance prediction. Such developments enable robust performance in zero-shot and few-shot configurations. Experiments on PeMS, NYCTaxi, NYCBike, and CHITaxi demonstrate that TraffiCoT-R outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on all the above-mentioned datasets in zero-shot configurations.

However, traditional port-based and classical machine learning-based malicious network traffic detection methods suffer from a dependence on expert experience and limited generalizability. In this paper, we propose a malicious traffic detection method based on an efficient federated learning framework of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called MT-FBERT. It offers two major advantages over most existing approaches. First, MT-FBERT pretrains BERT using two pre-training tasks along with an overall pre-training loss on large-scale unlabeled network traffic, allowing the model to automatically learn generalized traffic representations, which do not require human experience to extract the behavior features or label the malicious samples.

However, current research rarely considers the spatio-temporal clustering characteristics of armed conflicts. Here, we assess the distribution dynamics and driving factors of armed conflict from the perspective of armed conflict clusters, employing complex network dynamic community detection methods and interpretable machine learning approaches. The results show that conflict clusters vary in terms of regional distribution. Sub-Saharan Africa boasts the highest number of conflict clusters, accounting for 37.9% of the global total and covering 40.4% of the total cluster area. In contrast, South Asia and Afghanistan, despite having a smaller proportion of clusters at 12.1%, hold the second-largest cluster area, which is 18.1% of the total. The characteristics of different conflict networks are influenced by different factors. Historical exposure, socio-economic deprivation, and spatial structure are the primary determinants of conflict patterns, while climatic variables contribute less prominently as part of a broader system of environmental vulnerability. Moreover, the influence of driving factors shows spatial heterogeneity. By integrating cluster-level analysis with interpretable machine learning, this study offers a novel perspective for understanding the multidimensional characteristics of armed conflicts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","armed conflict clusters; driving factors; dynamic community detection; interpretable machine learning; spatial heterogeneity","Cluster analysis; Dynamics; Economics; Learning systems; Armed conflict; Armed conflict cluster; Community detection; Distribution characteristics; Driving factors; Dynamic communities; Dynamic community detection; Interpretable machine learning; Machine-learning; Spatial heterogeneity; Complex networks","This work was funded by the Youth Innovation Promotion Association (Grant No. 2023000117).","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","20798954","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014314822"

However, this shift has also heightened the demand for robust fraud detection systems across various financial institutions. While numerous fraud detection algorithms have been proposed in both academia and industry, significant challenges remain in the accurate identification of minority class samples and the effective capture of time series information during feature extraction. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a long short-term memory-logistic regression stacked ensemble model (LLSE) that integrates long short-term memory (LSTM) and logistic regression (LR). The first layer of the model extracts time series features by combining three independently trained LSTM base learners whose outputs are concatenated and passed to the second layer, an LR meta-learner, to generate the final predictions. This dual-layer decision-making mechanism effectively captures spatiotemporal correlation features in fraudulent transactions, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the model. The model's performance is evaluated via two publicly available credit card datasets. This study innovatively combines the TS-N2VA feature extraction model with the LLSE classifier to comprehensively enhance credit card fraud detection performance through both hidden feature extraction and classifier improvement. Experiments on two public credit card datasets demonstrate that the LLSE classifier achieves significantly better performance in identifying minority class samples while maintaining overall recognition accuracy, outperforming other fraud detection models in the experiments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credit card fraud; logistic regression; long short-term memory network; stacked ensemble model","Classification (of information); Crime; Decision making; Extraction; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Signal detection; Time series; Credit card fraud detections; Credit card frauds; Ensemble models; Features extraction; Logistics regressions; Long short-term memory network; Memory network; Performance; Short term memory; Stacked ensemble model; Long short-term memory","","","World Scientific","02181940; 17936403","","ISEKE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012935293"

In this context, synthetic human trajectory data is generated to simulate as close as possible to real-world human trajectories, often under summary statistics and distributional similarities. However, these similarities oversimplify complex human mobility patterns (a.k.a. ''Datasaurus''), resulting in intrinsic biases in both generative model design and benchmarks of the generated trajectories. Against this background, we propose MIRAGE, a huMan-Imitative tRAjectory GenErative model designed as a neural Temporal Point Process integrating an Exploration and Preferential Return model. It imitates the human decision-making process in trajectory generation, rather than fitting any specific statistical distributions as traditional methods do, thus avoiding the Datasaurus issue. We also propose a comprehensive task-based evaluation protocol beyond Datasaurus to systematically benchmark trajectory generative models on four typical downstream tasks, integrating multiple techniques and evaluation metrics for each task, to assess the ultimate utility of the generated trajectories. We conduct a thorough evaluation of MIRAGE on three real-world user trajectory datasets against a sizeable collection of baselines. Results show that compared to the best baselines, MIRAGE-generated trajectory data not only achieves the best statistical and distributional similarities with 59.0-67.7% improvement, but also yields the best performance in the task-based evaluation with 10.9-33.4% improvement. A series of ablation studies also validate the key design choices of MIRAGE. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","generative model; human mobility; simulation; trajectory","Data privacy; Decision making; Human computer interaction; Information management; Crowd managements; Distributional similarities; Generated trajectories; Generative model; Human mobility; Privacy concerns; Real-world; Simulation; Summary statistic; Task-based; Trajectories","","","Association for Computing Machinery","2154817X","9798400714542; 9798400712456; 9781450308373; 9781450315500; 1595936092; 9781450315609; 9781450315548; 9781450315562; 9781450315425; 9781450308137","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014325881"

Recently, several automated spatio-temporal forecasting methods have been proposed to automatically search the optimal neural network architecture for capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies. However, the existing automated approaches suffer from expensive neural architecture search overhead, which hinders their practical use and the further exploration of diverse spatio-temporal operators in a finer granularity. In this paper, we propose AutoSTF, a decoupled automatic neural architecture search framework for cost-effective automated spatio-temporal forecasting. From the efficiency perspective, we first decouple the mixed search space into temporal space and spatial space and respectively devise representation compression and parameter-sharing schemes to mitigate the parameter explosion. The decoupled spatio-temporal search not only expedites the model optimization process but also leaves new room for more effective spatio-temporal dependency modeling. From the effectiveness perspective, we propose a multi-patch transfer module to jointly capture multi-granularity temporal dependencies and extend the spatial search space to enable finer-grained layer-wise spatial dependency search. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of AutoSTF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, our proposed method achieves up to 13.48x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art automatic spatio-temporal forecasting methods while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.

Deep Learning (DL), a subfield of AI, utilizes multi-layer neural network algorithms to analyze various types of data, mimicking the neural network architecture of the human brain. One of the most prominent features of DL is its end-to-end learning mechanism, which excels at automatic feature extraction and pattern recognition in data. As multi-omics technologies rapidly evolve, the volume of omics data from cancer samples has surged, presenting a significant challenge in managing this vast amount of information. Due to its strong data processing capabilities, DL is increasingly applied across a range of cancer research areas, such as early detection and screening, diagnosis, molecular subtype classification, discovery of biomarkers, and predicting patient prognosis and treatment responses. DL integrates high-dimensional data from fields such as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, radiomics, and single-cell omics, enhancing our understanding of cancer development and advancing personalized treatment approaches. This paper reviews various DL models and their roles in analyzing complex data patterns, providing a review of DL applications in cancer multi-omics analysis research and emphasizing its potential in early detection, diagnosis, classification, and prognosis prediction. As DL models are introduced continuously, we expect their application in cancer research to become more extensive, thus propelling the advancement of cancer medicine. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; cancer early detection; deep learning; multi-omics; tumor biomarker","biological marker; tumor marker; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; data processing; deep learning; diagnosis; early cancer; epigenetics; feature extraction; human; malignant neoplasm; multiomics; nerve cell network; pattern recognition; personalized medicine; prediction; proteomics; radiomics; review; transcriptomics; treatment response; bioinformatics; genetics; genomics; metabolism; neoplasm; procedures; therapy; Biomarkers, Tumor; Computational Biology; Deep Learning; Genomics; Humans; Multiomics; Neoplasms; Neural Networks, Computer; Proteomics","This work was supported by Jilin Provincial Scientific and Technological Development Program (20240101275JC and YDZJ202401200ZYTS).","","Oxford University Press","14774054; 14675463","","","40874818","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014777669"

In contrast, Bayesian spatio-temporal statistical methods integrate prior knowledge and treat all model parameters as random variables, thereby forming a unified probabilistic inference framework. This enables the incorporation of a broader range of uncertainties and offers robustness in modelling small samples and dependent structures, making Bayesian methods highly advantageous and increasingly influential in spatio-temporal analysis. [Progress] From the perspective of methodological evolution, this paper systematically reviews mainstream Bayesian spatio-temporal statistical models from two complementary perspectives: traditional Bayesian statistics and the Bayesian machine learning. The former includes Bayesian Spatio-temporal Evolutionary Hierarchical Models, Bayesian Spatio-temporal Regression Hierarchical Models, Bayesian Spatial Panel Data Models, Bayesian Geographically Weighted Spatio-temporal Regression Models, Bayesian Spatio-temporal Varying Coefficient Models, and Bayesian Spatiotemporal Meshed Gaussian Process Model. The latter includes Bayesian Causal Forest Models, Bayesian Spatiotemporal Neural Networks, and Bayesian Graph Convolutional Neural Networks. In terms of application, the review highlights representative studies across domains such as public health, environmental sciences, socio-economic and public safety, as well as energy and engineering. [Prospect] Bayesian spatio-temporal statistical methods need to achieve breakthroughs in multi-source heterogeneous data modeling, integration with deep learning, incorporation of causal inference mechanisms, and optimization of high-performance computing. These advances are essential to balance theoretical rigor with practical adaptability and to promote the development of a next-generation spatio-temporal modeling paradigm characterized by causal inference, adaptive generalization, and intelligent analysis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayesian statistics; causal inference; hierarchical models; machine learning; spatio-temporal dependency modeling; spatio-temporal statistics","Bayesian networks; Deep learning; Economics; Learning systems; Public health; Regression analysis; Safety engineering; Sampling; Statistics; Bayesian; Bayesian statistics; Causal inferences; Dependency model; Hierarchical model; Machine-learning; Spatio-temporal; Spatio-temporal dependencies; Spatio-temporal dependency modeling; Spatio-temporal statistics; Hierarchical systems; Bayesian analysis; machine learning; panel data; spatiotemporal analysis; trend analysis","National Social Science Fund of China (Major Project), No.24&ZD183.","","Science Press","15608999","","","","Chinese","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012361351"

Machine learning-based intrusion detection techniques enhance IoT network security but often require centralized network data, posing significant risks to data privacy and security. Although federated learning (FL)-based network intrusion detection methods have emerged in recent years to address privacy concerns, they have not fully leveraged the advantages of graph neural networks (GNNs) for intrusion detection. To address this issue, we propose a federated spatiotemporal graph convolutional network (FedSTGCN) model, which integrates the capabilities of spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs) and federated learning. This framework enables collaborative model training across distributed IoT devices without requiring the sharing of raw data, thereby improving network intrusion detection accuracy while preserving data privacy. Extensive experiments are conducted on two widely used IoT intrusion detection datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that FedSTGCN outperforms other methods in both binary and multiclass classification tasks, achieving over 97% accuracy in binary classification tasks and over 92% weighted F1-score in multiclass classification tasks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data privacy; Federated learning (FL); Internet of Things (IoT); Network intrusion detection; Spatiotemporal graph neural network (STGNN); TP39","Collaborative learning; Computer crime; Convolutional neural networks; Edge computing; Graph neural networks; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Network intrusion; Network security; Privacy-preserving techniques; Classification tasks; Convolutional networks; Federated learning; Internet of thing; Intrusion-Detection; Network intrusion detection; Spatio-temporal graphs; Spatiotemporal graph neural network; Tp39; Internet of things","","","Zhejiang University","20959184; 20959230","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012283560"

However, most existing models for user location prediction suffer from two significant limitations: neglecting category information and overlooking the hierarchical relationship between specific locations and their corresponding categories. To overcome these challenges, we propose the hierarchy aware-based multi-task learning (HAMTL) framework, which jointly predicts the next location and its category. HAMTL extracts hierarchy information by constructing a hierarchy tree, which is then fused with other feature information before encoding. Finally, a hierarchical decoder is designed for prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that HAMTL outperforms seven baselines across all evaluation metrics, achieving a maximum Acc@1 improvement of over 18% compared with the state-of-the-art method. In addition, we show that the hierarchical decoder provides advantages over HAMTL on the basis of the effective modeling of hierarchy information. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Heterogeneous graph neural network; Hierarchical decoder; Hierarchy information; Location prediction; Multi-task learning","Decoding; Learning systems; Location; Multi-task learning; Neural networks; Graph neural networks; Heterogeneous graph; Heterogeneous graph neural network; Hierarchical decoder; Hierarchy information; High precision positioning; Location prediction; Multitask learning; Precision positioning technologies; User location; Forecasting","This work is supported by the Major Scientific and Technological Special Project of Henan Province (221100210100), Science and Technology Innovation leading Talents Subsidy Project of Central Plains (244200510038), and Henan Provincial Science and Technology Research Project (252102210038).","","Springer","15730484; 09208542","","JOSUE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012154532"

This hyperrealism consequently fails contemporary methods to reliably discriminate between original and fake videos. Therefore, to counter any threat caused by these next-generation artificially generated videos, dependable approaches are required to address this classification challenge. To achieve this objective this paper presents an interdisciplinary approach that integrates game theory with deep learning to bring a novel solution to the problem of deepfake detection and protect the detectors against anti-forensics attack. To the best of our knowledge, there does not exist any other work dedicated to video deepfake detection using the integrated approach of game theory and deep learning. The game is designed for two players to distinguish between pristine and deepfake videos. The game utilizes different strategies for the data manipulator as a player P<inf>1</inf> and the deepfake detector as P<inf>2</inf>. Strategies used for P<inf>1</inf> involve the formation of the subsets like open and close-set, combined subsets, imbalanced dataset, and post-processing attacks to create challenging strategies for P<inf>2</inf>. To counter the strategies of P<inf>1</inf>,we propose a novel Regularized Forensic Efficient Net (RFE Net) that employs regularization techniques, such as batch normalization, dropout, augmentation, and early stopping. Based on the P<inf>1</inf> move, the detector chooses the regularization techniques by considering factors such as generalizability and efficiency. Regularization-based strategies improve the performance of our model when compared to contemporary methods. Computation of the Nash equilibrium with the proposed zero-sum game helps to effectively detect deepfakes and leads the game to maximum payoff. Performance of the proposed game theory-based RFE Net was measured on standard and diverse datasets of FaceForensic++, DFDC preview, CelebDF, DFFD, and the World leader’s dataset, including cross-set and cross-corpus evaluation. Additionally, we also performed the post-processing attacks evaluation and explainability analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RFE Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods for deepfakes detection in the defined premises. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deepfakes; Game theory; Nash equilibrium; Post-processing attacks; Regularized forensics efficient net; Zero-sum game","Computer crime; Computer forensics; Crime; Deep learning; Energy security; Footage counters; Forensic engineering; Network security; Normal distribution; Risk assessment; Solvent extraction; Steganography; AI algorithms; Cutting edges; Deepfake; Nash equilibria; Performance; Post-processing; Post-processing attack; Regularization technique; Regularized forensic efficient net; Zero-sum game; Nash equilibrium","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the grant of the Punjab Higher Education Commission (PHEC) of Pakistan via Award No. (PHEC/ARA/PIRCA/20527/21).; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the Multimedia Signal Processing (MSP) research lab at the University of Engineering and Technology (UET) Taxila and SMILES lab at Oakland University, USA.

Current methods primarily focus on comparing current trajectory with historical patterns or detecting ship trajectory information to identify abnormal behaviors, which struggles to detect real-time ship abnormal states and joint risky behaviors between ships. To address these issues, an improved graph attention network was proposed for analyzing ship trajectory data from the Automatic Identification System. This approach designs two graph-coding structures: one is designed to capture the trajectory features of individual ships, while the other constructs the relationship features between ship trajectories. By enhancing the graph attention mechanism for each structure, the approach effectively identifies abnormal ship states and joint risky behaviors between ships. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high efficiency with detection accuracy of 95.64 % and inference time of 149.5(ms), thereby meeting the practical demands of detecting abnormal ship behaviors. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abnormal ship states; Attention mechanism; Automatic identification system; Graph attention network; Joint risky behaviors between ships","Crime; 'current; Abnormal ship state; Attention mechanisms; Automatic identification system; Behavior-based; Graph attention network; Joint risky behavior between ship; Maritime traffic; Risky behaviors; Ship behavior; Ships; artificial neural network; detection method; experimental study; maritime transportation; ship motion; traffic management","This document is the results of the research project funded by the Application of remote collaborative computing of foreign medicinal biological resources of Key R&D Program of Shandong Province under Grant 2018ASKJ01-05.","","Elsevier Ltd","00298018","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002784818"

Therefore, building an efficient and accurate in-vehicle intrusion detection model is crucial. However, most existing methods rely on pre-set fixed features and lack the ability to dynamically adapt to network changes. This leads to their poor performance in dealing with complex and ever-changing attack patterns, making it difficult to cope with diverse attacks in actual in-vehicular networks. To address this challenge, we have designed an in-vehicle intrusion detection model based on multi-channel graph convolution. The core idea is to construct corresponding spatiotemporal topology graphs and feature coupling graphs from the fine-grained level of in-vehicle network data streams and use multi-channel graph convolution to learn static standard node embeddings and adaptive shared node embeddings from different graph structures, and fully integrate these embedding vectors for the final detection task.

Deepfake detection is a technique consisting of frameworks, algorithms and approaches to predict manipulated contents namely, image, audio and video. To this end, we have analyzed and explored various deepfake detection frameworks by categorizing them as single-modal or multi-modal approaches. To provide better understanding and clarity, single-modal approaches are further categorized as conventional and advanced techniques. Conventional techniques extract complementary handcrafted features and classify them using machine-learning-based algorithms. On the other hand, advanced techniques adopt deep learning and hybrid algorithms to detect deepfakes. Multi-modal techniques utilize a mixture of two or more modalities for feature extraction and fuse them to obtain the final classification scores. These techniques are also categorized either as deep learning or hybrid techniques. The complementary features, multiple modalities, and deep learning models are fused adaptively using score-level or feature-level fusion. The advantages, features, practical applications, and limitations under each category are highlighted to address the challenges and determine future trends to counter deepfakes.

Traditional static embedding methods, which aggregate token-level representations, discard hierarchical and sequential relationships in file paths, leading to misclassification of anomalies. This study introduces a Transformer-based sequence modeling approach to classify anomalous file paths, addressing these limitations by preserving positional and contextual relationships. File paths from the NTFS Master File Table (MFT) were embedded using FastText to capture structural and contextual dependencies. Unlike static embeddings, the proposed method processes file paths as structured sequences to enhance anomaly detection accuracy. Extensive experiments showed that Transformer models generally outperformed traditional methods in detecting structured anomalies. The Transformer model with FastText embeddings (32 dimensions) achieved an accuracy of 0.9781 and an F1-score of 0.9782, while Random Forest with FastText embeddings (64 dimensions) achieved an accuracy of 0.9729 and an F1-score of 0.9729. These findings suggest that a hybrid anomaly detection framework combining Transformer-based models with traditional techniques could enhance robustness in forensic investigations. Future research should explore combining both methods to improve adaptability across diverse forensic scenarios. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","anomaly detection; digital forensics; file path analysis; sequence modeling; word embeddings","Computer crime; Computer forensics; Electronic crime countermeasures; Embeddings; Forensic engineering; Anomaly detection; Context-Aware; F1 scores; File path analyze; Path analysis; Path embedding; Sequence models; Transformer modeling; Word embedding","","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","20798954","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008954842"

Due to the development of public and private healthcare programs, many citizens receive better medical care benefits. Still, there is a need for financial transparency in these healthcare transactions, which has become a challenge. To ensure the delivery of more effective and higher-quality healthcare services, introducing healthcare fraudulent transactions prevention and detection tools in hospitals is necessary. In this paper, we propose how to inculcate a healthcare transaction monitoring system within an enterprise or organisation. Using machine and deep learning techniques, this research proposes a novel framework for analyzing health insurance data. Due to the complexity of medical information, detecting fraudulent transactions in the industry requires effort. Typically, patients, services, and providers (doctors, hospitals, pharmacies) are the main key elements of the healthcare ecosystem. As fraudsters continue to evolve their methods of conducting fraudulent transactions over time, an evolving fraud detection framework needs to be developed. Therefore, we proposed a framework that can identify fraud at the actor-level and further analyze the identified element (doctor, patient, and services) using an Anomaly transformer to evaluate the behavior of that particular identified element. Actor-level frauds are detected, 50% are at the patient level, 12% are at the service versus doctor level, 13% are at the service versus patient level, and 25% are at the physician level. Further, sequences of these elements are analyzed by the Anomaly transformer. All patient sequences’ anomaly scores are generated using a data-driven threshold, and fraudulent sequences are identified. Results of the Speciality-based Rule engine and the Anomaly transformers are compared to identify the anomaly finally. Once the frauds are identified, the proposed architecture enables the management to take disciplinary action against each involved element. The Accuracy of the proposed framework is 97%, The experimental results are validated using the insurance data of local hospital employees, and the domain expert has validated the detected fraud cases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anomaly detection; Anomaly rank; Anomaly score; Fraud detection; Healthcare; Insurance management; Sequence mining","Health insurance; Quality of service; Adaptive learning; Anomaly detection; Anomaly rank; Anomaly score; Fraud detection; Fraudulent transactions; Healthcare; Insurance management; Learning techniques; Sequence mining; Patient treatment","This project is funded by Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University Researchers Supporting Project number (PNURSP2025R411), Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","","Springer Nature","18686478; 18686486","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007521026"

Conventional prediction models are mostly regression-based, requiring multisource and fine-grained GIS data (e.g., socio-demographics, land use, POI), whose collection could be laborious and costly. Some data do not even exist for fast-growing cities in the developing world, largely hindering the application of the conventional models. Noting that high dimensional satellite images contain rich data about complex urban systems (e.g., density, land use, transportation network), we hypothesize that Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) can embed inherent urban features as the latent space, to predict DBS demand directly from satellite images effectively. To test the hypothesis, we took Shenzhen - a city with diverse urban forms as a case study. Pairwise satellite image and DBS drop-off heatmap during AM/PM and non-peak hours on a random workday became the input and output images for Pix2Pix, a proven GAN framework, to train the image-to-image translation at the 200 m level. Fake heatmaps were generated and validated by ground truth using loss functions including L1, L2, and Structure Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). R2 was also calculated to compare our pixelated results to conventional regression models. First, simply taking a satellite image as the input achieved ∼0.49 R2 (82 % SSIM), outperforming many regression-based models that require a bunch of numeric/vector inputs. Moreover, pixelating vector maps (e.g., metro station, road network, office building) onto satellite images significantly improved the accuracy (∼0.56 R2/90 % SSIM), outperforming some machine learning or hybrid deep learning models in this regard (R2 0.18–0.76). Therefore, GAN is plausible to predict DBS demand from solely satellite images, while feeding more urban layers significantly improves the predictive power. Our raster-oriented framework can effectively aid the decision-making process for DBS implementation and operation in developing countries where up-to-date GIS data is less accessible. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dockless bike-sharing (DBS); Generating adversarial networks (GAN); Geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI); Image-to-image; Parking demand; Satellite image","artificial intelligence; cycle transport; parking; prediction; public transport; satellite imagery; travel demand; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen","This research has received support from the URC Seed Fund for Basic Research for New Staff and the Start-up Fund from The University of Hong Kong (HKU).

A major challenge in achieving accurate predictions lies in identifying generalized patterns of criminal behavior from spatiotemporal features in crime data. Additionally, the inherent randomness and volatility of crime data at the spatiotemporal level introduce noise, which can mislead prediction models. While many effective spatiotemporal crime prediction methods have been proposed, most overlook this issue, reducing their ability to generalize. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep learning-based model, adaptive-GCNLSTM (Ada-GCNLSTM). Specifically, in the spatial feature extraction module, we enhance the model's ability to capture crime spatial distributions by leveraging graph convolutional networks to model spatial dependencies in conjunction with the maximum mean discrepancy to extract the universal features of crime data. We then incorporate a memory network based on long short-term memory network to capture the underlying relationships between temporal features. Through extensive experiments, our model demonstrates an average improvement of 11.7% in mean absolute error and 2.7% in root mean squared error across the three datasets, outperforming the best baseline model.

However, existing Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) often rely solely on accuracy, overlooking spatial and demographic disparities in their predictions. This oversight can lead to imbalanced resource allocation and exacerbate existing inequities in urban areas. This study introduces a Residual-Aware Attention (RAA) Block and an equality-enhancing loss function to address these disparities. By adapting the adjacency matrix during training and incorporating spatial disparity metrics, our approach aims to reduce local segregation of residuals and errors. We applied our methodology to urban prediction tasks in Chicago, utilizing travel demand datasets as an example. Our model achieved a 48% significant improvement in fairness metrics with only a 9% increase in error metrics. Spatial analysis of residual distributions revealed that models with RAA Blocks produced more equitable prediction results, particularly by reducing errors clustered in central regions, supporting more balanced and equitable urban planning and policy-making. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Algorithmic Fairness; Deep Learning; Equity; Urban Prediction","Errors; Forecasting; Investments; Neural networks; Traffic control; Urban planning; Algorithmic fairness; Algorithmics; Case-studies; Chicago; Deep learning; Equity; Graph neural networks; Prediction tasks; Spatio-temporal graphs; Urban prediction","Dingyi Zhuang acknowledges the support by the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) under the Vehicle Technology Program Award Number DE-EE0009211.

Exploring these advanced AI-based schemes and summarizing them in one place can help communities such as policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and researchers. In this direction, literature presents some comprehensive state-of-the-art studies, however, these studies lack a thorough review of the latest AI methods used in crime prediction. This systematic literature review aims to fill these gaps by exploring recent advancements in Machine Learning, especially in Deep Learning, for crime prediction. This study delves into various digital repositories to extract relevant research articles using a robust qualitative selection process. A total of 55 top-quality research articles have been analyzed in terms of publishing venue, employed predictive model, geographical area for experiments, use of real-time data, data source, and time spans for crime records. The detailed analysis reveals that IEEE Access is a top publishing venue for crime prediction-related articles. In the dimension of applied techniques, traditional methods persist (33%), while innovative hybrid models and emerging techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) show a trend toward diverse integration. The geographical focus primarily centers on U.S. cities, appearing in 56% of the papers, highlighting global disparities. Additionally, there is a significant gap in incorporating real-time data in crime prediction models, underscoring the need for future exploration in this direction. These findings provide valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and law enforcement agencies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI; Crime prediction; Deep learning; Machine learning; Systematic literature review","","","","Springer","24322717; 24322725","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005179373"

Accurately classifying and extracting core information such as heterogeneous sensors in MCS tasks plays a key role in the platform execution efficiency. However, existing methods struggle with extracting pivotal information from task descriptions that are open-domain, implicitly expressed, and linguistically diverse, ultimately hindering the efficiency of task assignment and execution. To overcome these challenges, we propose LKG-MF, a Label Knowledge Graph-powered Multi-task Framework, to achieve better core information mining performance in crowdsourcing and mobile crowd sensing tasks. Specifically, we first construct an MCS task dataset comprising over 10,000 real tasks from 7 platforms. Then we devise a label knowledge graph to capture heterogeneous semantics and relationships among labels and enhance label representation. Further, we present a multi-granularity feature extraction network to capture precise task-specific features. To optimize performance across disparate tasks, we incorporate a task-adaptive loss function that adeptly balances their optimization rates. Experimental results show that LKG-MF outperforms baselines average by 2.3%, significantly improving multi-task classification accuracy. Notably, when we integrate the LKG-MF model into MCS platforms, the task assignment efficiency is improved by 38.6% and the task completion time is reduced by 45.1%, which demonstrates the practical impact and effectiveness of our model in improving the performance of MCS platforms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crowdsourcing; Heterogeneous label knowledge graph; Mobile crowd sensing tasks; Multi-task Hybrid Reasoning","Crowdsourcing; Semantics; Heterogeneous label knowledge graph; Hybrid reasonings; Knowledge graphs; Mobile crowd sensing task; Multi tasks; Multi-task hybrid reasoning; Performance; Sensing platforms; Sensing tasks; Tasks assignments; Knowledge graph","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai (No. 24ZR1418500 ), the Education and Scientific Research Project of Shanghai (No. GSC2024017 ), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62032020 ).; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai, China (No. 24ZR1418500), the Education and Scientific Research Project of Shanghai, China (No. C2025017), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62032020).","","Elsevier Ltd","09574174","","ESAPE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215599972"

The performance of LMMs in specialized domains, such as social media, which integrates text, images, videos, and sometimes audio, remains an area of active interest. Effective analysis of such content requires models to interpret the complex interactions between different communication modalities and their influence on the conveyed message. This article explores GPT-4V(ision)'s performance in social multimedia analysis. We evaluate GPT-4V across five representative tasks: sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, fake news identification, demographic inference, and political ideology detection. Our approach includes a preliminary quantitative analysis for each task using existing benchmark datasets, followed by a review of the results and a selection of qualitative samples to demonstrate GPT-4V's performance in multimodal social media content analysis. GPT-4V shows effectiveness in these tasks, exhibiting capabilities like joint image-text understanding, contextual and cultural awareness, and commonsense knowledge application. However, challenges persist, including struggles with multilingual social multimedia comprehension and difficulty in adapting to the latest social media trends. It also sometimes generates incorrect information about evolving knowledge of celebrities and politicians. This preliminary study aims to inform further research across disciplines, particularly in computational social science and social media studies. The findings highlight the potential of LMMs to enhance our understanding of social media content and its users through multimodal analysis.

In practice, crime events are usually affected by a variety of factors from different views, e.g., the attributes of the region, the correlations between different regions, and the correlations between different categories of crime events. Moreover, these correlations are dynamically changing over time, which makes it difficult to learn the regularity and patterns in crime data for achieving accurate prediction. To address this issue, we proposed a new Multi-View Spatial-Temporal (MVST) model for fine-grained crime prediction. MVST model first builds a static region graph to capture the similarity between regions in terms of region attributes such as census records and economy statistics, and creates a time-dependent graph to capture the dynamic correlations between regions based on human mobility data. Meanwhile, both static and dynamic graphs are created to capture the correlations between different categories of crime events. After that, those graphs created from different views are fused together with a multi-view graph fusion module to achieve crime prediction with fine-grained time granularities, e.g., 4 hours and 12 hours. According to the experiments on two real crime datasets, our MVST model obviously outperforms existing crime prediction methods.

MTE-MTGNN introduces an interpretable graph construction layer founded on Multivariate Transfer Entropy, which effectively captures both spatial and temporal dependencies in the data. Empirical evaluations across five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach in terms of predictive accuracy. The model shows particular strength in few-shot scenarios where traditional forecasting approaches typically struggle, achieving performance improvements of up to 3% on the RRSE metric in the exchange rate dataset and up to 4% on the correlation metric in the Hungarian Chickenpox dataset compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

However, attacks against GNN-based fraud detectors and their risks have rarely been studied, thereby leaving potential threats unaddressed. Recent findings suggest that frauds are increasingly organized as gangs or groups. In this work, we design attack scenarios where fraud gangs aim to make their fraud nodes misclassified as benign by camouflaging their illicit activities in collusion. Based on these scenarios, we study adversarial attacks against GNN-based fraud detectors by simulating attacks of fraud gangs in three real-world fraud cases: spam reviews, fake news, and medical insurance frauds. We define these attacks as multi-target graph injection attacks and propose MonTi, a transformer-based Multi-target one-Time graph injection attack model. MonTi simultaneously generates attributes and edges of all attack nodes with a transformer encoder, capturing interdependencies between attributes and edges more effectively than most existing graph injection attack methods that generate these elements sequentially. Additionally, MonTi adaptively allocates the degree budget for each attack node to explore diverse injection structures involving target, candidate, and attack nodes, unlike existing methods that fix the degree budget across all attack nodes. Experiments show that MonTi outperforms the state-of-the-art graph injection attack methods on five real-world graphs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Network theory (graphs); Attack methods; Attacks scenarios; Effective tool; Fraud detection; Graph neural networks; Malicious behavior; Multi-targets; Network-based; Potential threats; Real-world","This research was supported by an NRF grant funded by MSIT 2022R1A2C4001594 (Extendable Graph Representation Learning) and an IITP grant funded by MSIT 2022-0-00369, RS-2022-II220369 (Development of AI Technology to support Expert Decision-making that can Explain the Reasons/Grounds for Judgment Results based on Expert Knowledge).","Walsh, T.; Shah, J.; Kolter, Z.","Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence","23743468; 21595399","9781577358879; 157735897X; 9781577358978; 1577358872; 9781577358800","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004004886"

However, SGL models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, compromising their practical utility. While adversarial training (AT) has been widely used to bolster model robustness, our study finds that traditional AT exacerbates performance disparities between majority and minority classes under ZID, potentially leading to irreparable losses due to underreporting critical risk events. In this paper, we first demonstrate the smaller top-k gradients and lower separability of minority class are key factors contributing to this disparity. To address these issues, we propose MinGRE, a framework for Minority Class Gradients and Representations Enhancement. MinGRE employs a multi-dimensional attention mechanism to reweight spatiotemporal gradients, minimizing the gradient distribution discrepancies across classes. Additionally, we introduce an uncertainty-guided contrastive loss to improve the inter-class separability and intra-class compactness of minority representations with higher uncertainty. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the MinGRE framework not only significantly reduces the performance disparity across classes but also achieves enhanced robustness compared to existing baselines. These findings underscore the potential of our method in fostering the development of more equitable and robust models. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Adversarial machine learning; Key factors; Learning models; Management tasks; Model robustness; Performance; Risks management; Spatio-temporal graphs; Uncertainty; Urban risk; Zero-inflated; Risk management","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 72434005, Grant 72225011 and Grant 72293575.","Walsh, T.; Shah, J.; Kolter, Z.","Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence","23743468; 21595399","9781577358879; 157735897X; 9781577358978; 1577358872; 9781577358800","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003952127"

Besides accuracy, interpretability is also a key requirement for spatiotemporal forecasting models to justify the decisions. Interpretation of the spatiotemporal forecasting mechanism is, however, challenging due to the complexity of multi-source spatiotemporal features, the non-intuitive nature of spatiotemporal patterns for non-expert users, and the presence of spatial heterogeneity in the data. Currently, no existing deep learning model intrinsically interprets the complex predictive process learned from multi-source spatiotemporal features. To bridge the gap, we propose GeoPro-Net, an intrinsically interpretable spatiotemporal model for spatiotemporal event forecasting problems. GeoPro-Net introduces a novel Geo-concept convolution operation, which employs statistical tests to extract predictive patterns in the input as “Geo-concepts”, and condenses the “Geo-concept-encoded” input through interpretable channel fusion and geographic-based pooling. In addition, GeoPro-Net learns different sets of prototypes of concepts inherently, and projects them to real-world cases for interpretation. Comprehensive experiments and case studies on four real-world datasets demonstrate that GeoPro-Net provides better interpretability while still achieving competitive prediction performance compared with state-of-the-art baselines. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","City management; Interpretability; Multi-Sources; Prediction modelling; Public safety; Safety management; Spatio-temporal forecasting; Spatio-temporal prediction; Spatiotemporal event; Spatiotemporal feature; Deep learning","","Walsh, T.; Shah, J.; Kolter, Z.","Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence","23743468; 21595399","9781577358879; 157735897X; 9781577358978; 1577358872; 9781577358800","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003905911"

This discrepancy arises primarily from the high costs associated with the input of existing representation models, which often require street views and mobility data. To address this, we develop a novel, training-free method that leverages large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap to derive geolocation representations (LLMGeovec). LLMGeovec can represent the geographic semantics of city, country, and global scales, which acts as a generic enhancer for spatio-temporal learning. Specifically, by direct feature concatenation, we introduce a simple yet effective paradigm for enhancing multiple spatio-temporal tasks including geographic prediction (GP), long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), and graph-based spatio-temporal forecasting (GSTF). LLMGeovec can seamlessly integrate into a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal learning models, providing immediate enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMGeovec achieves global coverage and significantly boosts the performance of leading GP, LTSF, and GSTF models. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Geo-spatial; Geographics; Geolocations; Graph-based; Language model; Natural languages; Representation model; Spatio-temporal forecasting; Spatio-temporal learning; Time series forecasting; Natural language processing systems","The work described in this paper was supported by grants from the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU/15206322 and PolyU/15227424)","Walsh, T.; Shah, J.; Kolter, Z.","Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence","23743468; 21595399","9781577358879; 157735897X; 9781577358978; 1577358872; 9781577358800","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003903676"

Some of these weights can be missing, especially in a road network where traffic data may not be available for every road. In this article, we study the stochastic weight completion (SWC) problem, which computes the weight distributions of missing road edges. This is difficult, due to the intricate temporal and spatial correlations among neighboring edges. Besides, the road network can be sparse, i.e., there is a lack of traveling information in a large portion of the network. To tackle these challenges, we propose a multi-granularity framework for Region-Wise Graph Completion (RegGC). To learn coarse spatial correlations among distantly located roads, we construct a region-wise hypergraph neural architecture based on semantic region dependencies. For finer spatial correlations, we incorporate contextual road network properties (e.g., speed limits, lane counts, and road types). Moreover, it incorporates recent and periodic dimensions of road traffic. We evaluate RegGC against 10 existing methods on 3 real road network datasets. They show that RegGC is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art solutions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hypergraphs; Sparsity; Spatial Data Mining; Stochastic Weight Completion","Highway traffic control; Motor transportation; Street traffic control; Hyper graph; Incident detection; Multi-granularity; Network applications; Road network; Sparsity; Spatial correlations; Spatial data mining; Stochastic weight completion; Stochastics; Semantic Segmentation","Funding text 1: Xiaolin Han, Xuequn Shang, and Yikun Zhang were supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 62302397, 62433016), the fund of Laboratory for Advanced Computing and Intelligence Engineering (No. 2023-LYJJ-01-021), and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China under Grant No. D5000230191.

However, previous studies have been constrained by limited sample sizes and inefficient, time-consuming methodologies. To address these limitations, we developed a deep learning framework to evaluate campus walking perceptions across four universities in China's Yangtze River Delta region. Utilizing 15,596 Baidu Street View Images (BSVIs), and perceptual ratings from 100 volunteers across four dimensions—aesthetics, security, depression, and vitality—we employed four machine learning models to predict perceptual scores. Our results demonstrate that the Random Forest (RF) model outperformed others in predicting aesthetics, security, and vitality, while linear regression was most effective for depression. Spatial analysis revealed that perceptions of aesthetics, security, and vitality were concentrated in landmark areas and regions with high pedestrian flow. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that buildings exhibited stronger correlations with depression (β = 0.112) compared to other perceptual aspects. Moreover, vegetation (β = 0.032) and meadows (β = 0.176) elements significantly enhanced aesthetics. This study offers actionable insights for optimizing campus walking environments from a student-centered perspective, emphasizing the importance of spatial design and visual elements in enhancing students' perceptual experiences. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","accuracy; adult; Article; China; college student; controlled study; data quality; decision tree; deep learning; depression; environment; esthetics; female; human; imagery; machine learning; major clinical study; male; mean absolute error; mental health; multiple linear regression analysis; Munchausen syndrome; Munchausen syndrome by proxy; pedestrian; precipitation; random forest; reliability; river; sample size; segmentation algorithm; spatial analysis; student; training; vegetation; walking; psychology; university; young adult; Adult; Esthetics; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Students; Universities; Walking; Young Adult","","","Public Library of Science","19326203","","POLNC","40203019","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002309370"

However, existing models struggle with handling small sample sizes for spatial prediction tasks across large areas. For exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), they are susceptible to distortion from local outliers and lack reliable interpretability methods that consider causal relationships. This study proposes Geographical Graph Attention Networks (GeoGATs), which are spatial deep learning models based on the principle of spatial (geographic) similarity. Two variants of the model are designed, namely GeoGAT-P for spatial prediction and GeoGAT-E for ESDA. Case studies using U.S. election data and homicide data demonstrate that GeoGAT-P can achieve more accurate predictions over a large spatial extent with a small sample size than existing models. GeoGAT-E can achieve decent performance in comparison with existing models and understand complex spatial relationships.

Contemporary crime occurrence prediction models predominantly leverage deep learning techniques, focusing on capturing the spatio-temporal dependencies within crime data. Analysis of crime data reveals correlations among different crime types, indicating shared change patterns. Leveraging these correlations among crime types significantly enhances the accuracy of crime occurrence predictions. Nevertheless, existing crime occurrence prediction models frequently overlook the utilization of these type correlations. To solve this problem, we propose a new crime occurrence prediction model with multi-type crime correlation learning: the Multi-type Relations Aware Graph Neural Networks (MRAGNN). The model dynamically constructs a spatial/type graph structure of crime data and employs dynamic graph networks to capture both spatio-temporal and type-temporal dependencies within the data. We introduce a cross-modal gated fusion mechanism to fuse the representations of two dependencies. Furthermore, we develop an improved multi-label classification focal loss to address the challenges posed by the imbalance in crime occurrence data on classification results.

The review also discusses traditional machine learning approaches, including supervised and unsupervised learning, alongside cutting-edge advancements in deep learning, such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks, attention mechanisms, and reinforcement learning frameworks. Despite significant progress, HAR still faces critical challenges, including handling environmental variability, ensuring model interpretability, and achieving high recognition accuracy in complex, real-world scenarios. Future research directions emphasise the need for improved multimodal sensor fusion, adaptive and personalised models, and the integration of edge computing for real-time analysis.

However, current prediction models are often constrained by single-source data due to insufficient consideration of complex influencing factors, resulting in limitations in understanding and predicting cyberattacks. To address this issue, we comprehensively consider multiple data sources including cyberattacks, bilateral interactions, armed conflicts, international trade, and national attributes, and propose an interpretable multimodal data fusion framework for predicting cyberattacks among countries. On one hand, we design a dynamic multi-view graph neural network model incorporating temporal interaction attention and multi-view attention, which effectively captures time-varying dynamic features and the importance of node representations from various modalities. Our proposed model exhibits greater performance in comparison to many cutting-edge models, achieving an F1 score of 0.838. On the other hand, our interpretability analysis reveals unique characteristics of national cyberattack behavior.

Among various methods, diffusion model-based approaches show notable performance improvements. However, existing methods often cause disharmonious boundaries between missing and known regions and overlook long-range dependencies in missing data estimation, leading to suboptimal results. To address these issues, we propose a Diffusion-based time Series Data Imputation (DSDI) framework. We develop a weight-reducing injection strategy that incorporates the predicted values of missing points with reducing weights into the reverse diffusion process to mitigate boundary inconsistencies. Further, we introduce a multi-scale S4-based U-Net, which combines hierarchical information from different levels via multi-resolution integration to capture long-term dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing imputation methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data imputation; Diffusion model; Long-term dependencies; Time series data","Data assimilation; Data imputation; Diffusion model; Long-range dependencies; Long-term dependencies; Missing data estimation; Missing values; Model based approach; Multivariate time series; Performance; Time-series data; Spatio-temporal data","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61806074).","","Elsevier B.V.","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214361300"

Urbanization generates substantial outcomes and opportunities while raising challenges including congestion, air pollution, inequality, etc., calling for efficient and reasonable solutions to sustainable developments. Fortunately, booming technologies generate large-scale data of complex cities, providing a chance to propose data-driven solutions for sustainable urban developments. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of data-driven urban sustainability practice. In this review article, we conceptualize MetaCity, a general framework for optimizing resource usage and allocation problems in complex cities with data-driven approaches. Under this framework, we decompose specific urban sustainable goals, e.g., efficiency and resilience, review practical urban problems under these goals, and explore the probability of using data-driven technologies as potential solutions to the challenge of complexity. On the basis of extensive urban data, we integrate urban problem discovery, operation of urban systems simulation, and complex decision-making problem solving into an entire cohesive framework to achieve sustainable development goals by optimizing resource allocation problems in complex cities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; data-driven methods; sustainable development; urban complex systems","Sustainable development goals; Data driven; Data-driven methods; Large scale data; Resource usage; Resources allocation; Sustainability practices; Sustainable urban development; Urban complex system; Urban problems; Urban sustainability; Sustainable city","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (U23B2030, 62302261) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (23IAA02114).

However, lack of data, methodologies, and computer processing power have hampered a formal quantitative examination of neighbourhood relational dynamics. To make progress on this issue, this study proposes a graph neural network (GNN) approach that permits combining and evaluating multiple sources of information about internal characteristics of neighbourhoods, their past characteristics, and flows of groups among them, potentially providing greater expressive power in predictive models. By exploring a public large-scale dataset from Yelp, we show the potential of our approach for considering structural connectedness in predicting neighbourhood attributes, specifically to predict local culture. Results are promising from a substantive and methodologically point of view. Substantively, we find that either local area information (e.g. area demographics) or group profiles (tastes of Yelp reviewers) give the best results in predicting local culture, and they are nearly equivalent in all studied cases. Methodologically, exploring group profiles could be a helpful alternative where finding local information for specific areas is challenging, since they can be extracted automatically from many forms of online data. Thus, our approach could empower researchers and policy-makers to use a range of data sources when other local area information is lacking. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cultural dimensions; graph neural network; group profiles; Neighbourhood change; yelp data","culture; machine learning; neighborhood","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the project SocialNet (Process, 2023/00148-0 from Sao Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP), and National Council for Scientific and Technological - CNPq (grants 314603/2023-9 and 441444/2023-7).","","SAGE Publications Ltd","23998091; 23998083","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000804955"

Time series can represent different real-life phenomena, such as the behaviour of the stock market, variations in temperature and other meteorological data, the behaviour of banking credit/debit card consumption, among others. In addition, this work presents a 4-step methodology for preprocessing data and detecting anomalies on a time series dataset representing the spending of debit and credit card customers. A synthetic anomaly injection technique was applied to validate the models.

In this work, we provide a quantitative analysis of the GeoAI literature from the spatial, temporal, and semantic aspects. We briefly discuss the history of AI and GeoAI by highlighting some pioneering work. Then we discuss the current landscape of GeoAI by selecting five representative subdomains including remote sensing, urban computing, Earth system science, cartography, and geospatial semantics. Finally, we highlight several unique future research directions of GeoAI which are classified into two groups: GeoAI method development challenges and GeoAI Ethics challenges. Topics include heterogeneity-aware GeoAI, knowledge-guided GeoAI, spatial representation learning, geo-foundation models, fairness-aware GeoAI, privacy-aware GeoAI, as well as interpretable and explainable GeoAI.

Recently, using image data and deep learning to investigate the interactions between humans and urban infrastructure has been a popular approach since the fast development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, the convergence of data fusion, deep learning, and human-urban infrastructure interaction studies remains underexplored. Here we systematically analyze 3,552 papers from 2013 to 2023 that use image data to investigate the intersection area of data fusion, deep learning, and human and urban infrastructure interactions, aiming to elucidate the relationships among these three key elements. We found that the cross-applications of deep learning in the papers reviewed are not standardized. Given the trend of diversified data fusion, data fusion about real-world dynamic interactions is scarce. Lastly, four potential future research directions are identified: (1) understanding the dynamic and complex interaction processes; (2) exploring the potential and standards for the application of deep learning; (3) focusing more on research concerning cities in the Global South; (4) establishing suitable training datasets for the interaction between urban infrastructures and humans, which may provide valuable insights for applying foundation models in future urban studies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data fusion; Deep learning; Foundation models; Image data; SDG; Urban studies","artificial intelligence; learning; sustainability; sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goal; urban area; urbanization","The research was supported by 'National Natural Science Foundation of China' (42171452).","","Elsevier B.V.","1872826X; 15698432","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214308062"

This study introduces an innovative contrastive learning framework coupled with a transformer architecture for spatiotemporal traffic state prediction, designed to capture the spatio-temporal heterogeneity inherent in traffic. The transformer structure functions as the upper level of the prediction framework to minimize the prediction errors between the input and predicted output. Based on the self-supervised contrastive learning, the lower level in the framework is proposed to discern the spatio-temporal heterogeneity and embed the latent characteristic of traffic flow by regenerating the augmentation features. Then, a soft clustering problem is applied between the upper level and lower level to category the types of traffic flow characteristics by minimizing the joint loss across each cluster. Subsequently, the proposed model is evaluated through a real-world highway traffic flow dataset for bench marking against several latest existing models. The experimental results affirm that the proposed model considerably enhances traffic state prediction accuracy. In terms of precision metrics, the model records a Mean Absolute Error of 13.31 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 7.85%, reflecting marked improvements of 2.0% and 14.5% respectively over the latest and most competitive baseline model. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that capacity of the proposed method to learn the cluster patterns of spatio-temporal traffic dynamics reflected by calibrated fundamental diagrams. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contrastive learning; Fundamental diagram; Soft clustering; Traffic state prediction; Transformer","Motor transportation; Prediction models; Street traffic control; Fundamental diagram; Soft clustering; Spatio-temporal; State prediction; Temporal heterogeneities; Traffic flow; Traffic management and controls; Traffic state; Traffic state prediction; Transformer; Self-supervised learning; calibration; control system; error analysis; experimental study; heterogeneity; model test; precision; prediction; traffic management; transportation system; transportation technology","This study was funded and carried out as part of the VINNOVA project (2023-01042) supported by Sweden's Innovation Agency, the Area of Advance Transport at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, and the e-MATS project (P2023-00029) funded by the Joint Programming Initiative Urban Europe.

Previous works mainly focus on employing feature-based regression or fitting models with supposed spatio-temporal distribution to tackle this challenge, but are normally short of the following considerations: 1) mutual evolutionary influence, i.e., the dynamic evolution of interactions and dependencies among anomaly events, is changing along with the timeline and alters the probabilities or patterns of their occurrences dynamically; 2) messy features, i.e., complex attributes in the data but with noise, are difficult to select and aggregate for the representation learning algorithm with uncertainty and redundancy. To address the research gap, we put forward a co-evolutionary graph convolutional network model to explicate the dynamically spatio-temporal anomaly patterns. Specifically, we firstly take advantage of a fuzzy-rough set-based algorithm to select features by discovering the specialty and permanence attributes of different interaction features. Then, we propose a co-evolutionary learning method to embed the dynamically temporal influence into latent features with selected interaction information. Finally, we design a graph convolutional network with an attention mechanism to formulate the mutually spatial effects among the anomaly events. The proposed model is verified on the New York City crime records from the real-world, and extensive experiments show that our approach achieves 0.10129, 0.09958 and 0.10034 of the MAE (hour) in the action, location, and action-location time inference tasks, and 0.7973 and 0.4678 of the accuracy in the action and location type inference tasks, which outperform state-of-arts by 24.00%, 50.60%, 11.10%, 10.56% and 21.53% at most, respectively. Hyper-parameter and ablation experiments are also carried out further to demonstrate the sensitivity and effectiveness of our model. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anomaly event inference; co-evolutionary process; graph convolutional network; public security; spatio-temporal data","Contrastive Learning; Graph neural networks; Inference engines; Normal distribution; Anomaly event inference; Co-evolutionary; Co-evolutionary process; Convolutional networks; Crime Prevention; Graph convolutional network; Network models; Public security; Spatio-temporal; Spatio-temporal data; Convolutional neural networks","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program under Grant 2023YFB3107400, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62272371, Grant 62103323, Grant U24B20185, Grant T2442014, Grant 62161160337, Grant 62132011, and Grant U21B2018, in part by Initiative Postdocs Supporting Program under Grant BX20190275 and Grant BX20200270, in part by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under Grant 2019M663723 and Grant 2021M692565, in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant xzy012024144, and in part by Shaanxi Province Key Industry Innovation Program under Grant 2023-ZDLGY-38 and Grant 2021ZDLGY01-02.

Traditional machine learning models have long struggled to capture complex crime patterns, primarily due to the intricate interdependence of spatial and temporal data. However, recent advancements in machine learning, particularly with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer a new perspective. GNNs have demonstrated remarkable success in various applications and they can also play a significant role in crime analysis and prediction. Therefore, in this work, we explore such a potential by examining two distinct spatiotemporal GNN architectures, namely Dynamic Self-Attention Network (DySAT) and Evolving Graph Convolutional Network (EvolveGCN), assessing and comparing their effectiveness for crime prediction. Moreover, we propose a data modeling framework that integrates crime, street map graphs, and urban data, which is fundamental to properly train the GNN models. As far as we know, there is no consolidated methodology to integrate those three modalities of data, being a relevant contribution of this work. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of GNNs in crime prediction tasks, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field of crime prevention and public safety enhancement. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crime prediction; Data modeling; Graph neural networks","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Convolutional neural networks; Crime; Prediction models; Crime prediction; Critical researches; Data modeling; Graph neural networks; Machine learning techniques; Predicting crimes; Public safety; Research areas; Resources allocation; Sao Paulo","This work was supported by CNPq (#307184/2021-8) and FAPESP (#2022/09091-8, #2023/16334-7, #2013/07375-0, #2023/15618-1).

The current approaches suffer from occlusions, cross-camera person re ID and small-scale weapon detection, leading to the lack of a complete and inaccurate summary. Moreover, these methods are not very robust against changing environments and do not incorporate much feedback for continuous improvement operations. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a comprehensive system for video summarization through multimodal fusion and spatiotemporal analysis across multiple camera streams. The system integrates the following advanced technologies: AGMFN for person detection and identity matching which employs multi-head attention to fuse RGB frames, motion data and optical flow. YOLOv8 with Feature Pyramid Networks is used for multiple Scale weapon detection in order to capture smaller, partially occluded objects within cluttered scenes. Spatio-temporal action localization is achieved with the help of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks, along with Temporal Attention Networks that capture all weapon-related actions with the best set of critical frames. Finally, a feedback-driven reinforcement learning framework named RL-HITL allows continuous improvement based on human input, which enhances the adaptability of the system over temporal instance sets. This integrated system has good accuracy in person detection ranging from 95-98%, weapon detection at 92-95% and even action localization ranging from 88-91%. At the same time, it reduces the length of video by 70-80%. Real-time learning through RL-HITL ensures model refinement and hereby gives long-term benefits in security and surveillance application, hence analysis at a crime scene for different scenarios. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crime scene analysis; multimodal fusion; person detection; process; video summarization; weapon detection","Footage counters; Network security; Reinforcement learning; Remote sensing; System-on-chip; Continuous improvements; Crime scene analyze; Crime scenes; Localisation; Multi-modal fusion; Person detection; Process; Scene analysis; Video summarization; Weapons detection; Convolutional neural networks","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217566766"

However, methods for effectively integrating spatial multimodal data to infer CCIs are still lacking. Here, the authors propose a deep learning method for integrating features through co-convolution, called SpaGraphCCI, to effectively integrate data from different modalities of SRT by projecting gene expression and image feature into a low-dimensional space. SpaGraphCCI can achieve significant performance on datasets from multiple platforms including single-cell resolution datasets (AUC reaches 0.860–0.907) and spot resolution datasets (AUC ranges from 0.880 to 0.965). SpaGraphCCI shows better performance by comparing with the existing deep learning-based spatial cell communication inference methods. SpaGraphCCI is robust to high noise and can effectively improve the inference of CCIs. We test on a human breast cancer dataset and show that SpaGraphCCI can not only identify proximal cell communication but also infer new distal interactions. In summary, SpaGraphCCI provides a practical tool that enables researchers to decipher spatially resolved cell–cell communication based on spatial transcriptome data. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","bioinformatics; feature extraction; graphs; learning (artificial intelligence)","Deep learning; Diseases; Gene expression; Tissue homeostasis; Cell communication; Cell-cell communications; Cell-cell interaction; Feature integration; Features extraction; Graph; Learning (artificial intelligence); Performance; Spatial cells; Spatially resolved; Tissue; transcriptome; algorithm; bioinformatics; breast tumor; cell communication; deep learning; gene expression profiling; genetics; human; metabolism; pathology; single cell analysis; Algorithms; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Communication; Computational Biology; Deep Learning; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Single-Cell Analysis; Transcriptome","This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 62272211; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, Grant/Award Number: 2024JJ6395, 2023JJ30535; Innovation Platform and Talent Programme (No. 2023TP1047); and Clinical Research 4310 Programme of the First Affiliated Hospital of the University of South China (20224310NHYCG05).","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","17518849; 17518857","","","39846423","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215987723"

Deep learning, SVMs, DTs, and EMs are only some of the machine learning (ML) techniques that are covered. Data mining methods and feature selection optimization using evolutionary algorithms like genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization are also covered. The parallelization and dissemination of CI methods across distributed computing environments is also investigated, as is the incorporation of CI with widely recognized frameworks for processing extensive datasets, such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark. The chapter also explores the constraints and difficulties connected with utilizing computational intelligence approaches for analyzing large datasets. Privacy, scalability, interpretability, and computing efficiency are among the topics investigated. Current research initiatives that try to address these problems are described.

To this end, this paper promotes the concept of EGI, explores its scope and core principles, and conducts a comprehensive survey concerning recent research efforts on this emerging field. Specifically, this paper introduces and discusses: 1) fundamentals of edge computing and graph learning, 2) emerging techniques centering on the closed loop between graph intelligence and edge networks, and 3) open challenges and research opportunities of future EGI. By bridging the gap across communication, networking, and graph learning areas, we believe that this survey can garner increased attention, foster meaningful discussions, and inspire further research ideas in EGI. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; Edge computing; edge intelligence; graph learning; wireless communication","Adversarial machine learning; Federated learning; Closed-loop; Computing facilities; Edge computing; Edge intelligence; EDGE Networks; Graph learning; Graphs and networks; Intelligent Services; Network edges; Wireless communications; Contrastive Learning","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","1553877X","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214840773"

However, defining abnormal events remains challenging, which hinders their effectiveness and limits the use of supervised techniques. The existing method have difficulty in accurately detecting and tracking the objects, that minimizes the detection and tracking performance. In this research, the You Only Look Once v7 (YOLO v7) - Distance Intersection of Union (D-IoU) and Earth Mover Distance (EMD) approach is proposed to detect and track the objects and anomalies in video surveillance. The D-IoU loss function is used in the YOLO v7 model improves the precision of bounding box prediction by considering the distance between centres of the bounding box, which is useful for the accurate localization of object. Then, the features are extracted by using the Inception V3 approach that extracts the meaningful features that help differentiate the anomalies in the detected object. To detect the anomalies, the EMD method is used which effectively detects the anomalies. The YOLO v7 – D-IoU and EMD approach obtained 96.1% accuracy on UCSD Ped 1 datasets and 98.8% accuracy on UCSD Ped 2 dataset. The proposed method showed effective performance when compared to conventional methods like Three-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN). © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bounding box; Distance intersection of union; Earth mover distance; Video surveillance; You only look once v7","","","","Intelligent Network and Systems Society","21853118; 2185310X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214255064"

However, most existing graph contrastive learning methods do not perform well in capturing local–global spatial dependencies or designing contrastive learning schemes for both spatial and temporal dimensions. We argue that these methods can not well extract the spatial-temporal features and are easily affected by data noise. In light of these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative Urban Spatial-Temporal Graph Contrastive Learning framework (UrbanGCL) to improve the accuracy of urban traffic flow forecasting. Specifically, UrbanGCL proposes multi-level data augmentation to address data noise and incompleteness, learn both local and global topology features. The augmented traffic feature matrices and adjacency matrices are then fed into a simple yet effective dual-branch network with shared parameters to capture spatial-temporal correlations within traffic sequences. Moreover, we introduce spatial and temporal contrastive learning auxiliary tasks to alleviate the sparsity of supervision signal and extract the most critical spatial-temporal information. Extensive experimental results on four real-world urban datasets demonstrate that UrbanGCL significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, with the maximum improvement reaching nearly 8.80%. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contrastive learning; Graph neural networks; Spatial-temporal graphs; Traffic flow forecasting","","","","Springer International Publishing","21994536; 21986053","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213384501"

The growth of these services has underscored the importance of vehicle dispatching and resource allocation, making demand forecasting a crucial operational focus. Existing methods often overlook key contextual information in the urban environment when exploring the spatiotemporal dependencies of demand sequences. In this study, we propose a novel approach: Weather-Conditioned Multi-Graph Network (WGNN). This method captures the similarity of supply-demand relationships in different spatial regions and integrates weather information into the spatiotemporal dependency model for predicting ride-hailing demand. Specifically, two methods are proposed for constructing region-related graphs, utilizing spatiotemporal attention and multi-graph convolution to model spatial correlations. Weather information and supply-demand relationships are modeled through cross-attention, and multi-period information is captured through a time block. Additionally, cross-region contrastive learning is employed to dynamically capture effective information components, reducing the impact of redundant information and achieving precise demand prediction.

The initial database search identified 2,160 articles, of which 203 were included in this review after rigorous screening and assessment. This study revealed that the most commonly used anomaly detection techniques employed are deep learning networks such as LSTM, CNN, and autoencoders, alongside one-class SVM. Most detection models were trained using real-world operational vehicle data, although anomalies, such as attacks and faults, were often injected artificially into the datasets. The models were evaluated primarily using five key evaluation metrics: recall, accuracy, precision, F1-score, and false positive rate. The most frequently used set of evaluation metrics for detection models were accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The review makes several recommendations to improve future work related to anomaly detection models. It recommends providing comprehensive assessment of the anomaly detection models and emphasise the importance to share models publicly to facilitate collaboration within the research community and enable further validation. Recommendations also include the need for benchmarking datasets with predefined anomalies or cyberattacks (with comprehensive threat modelling) to test and improve the effectiveness of the proposed anomaly detection models. Future research should focus on the deployment of anomaly based detection in vehicles to evaluate their performance in real-world driving conditions, and explore systems using communication protocols beyond CAN, such as Ethernet and FlexRay. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","anomaly detection; artificial intelligence; Connected and autonomous vehicles; intrusion detection system","Anomaly detection; Anomaly detection models; Artificial intelligence methods; Autonomous Vehicles; Connected and autonomous vehicle; Detection models; Evaluation metrics; F1 scores; Intrusion Detection Systems; Systematic literature review; Network intrusion","Received 30 September 2023; revised 4 May 2024; accepted 10 October 2024.

In the age of big data, the volume of data produced daily is immense, the data types are varied, the value density is low, and the data continues to accumulate over time. These characteristics make data processing more challenging. In particular, unstructured data, unlike structured data, does not have a fixed format, and its volume is large and variable, which presents a significant challenge to traditional data processing techniques. Nowadays, researchers have been employing graph neural network models to analyze unstructured data. However, real-world graph structures are dynamic and time-varying, and the static graph neural network cannot effectively learn graph node embeddings and network structures. To address the challenges mentioned above, we propose a self-aware dynamic graph network structure learning model, called GraphSense. The algorithm consists of two modules: self-sensing neighborhood aggregation algorithm and dynamic graph structure learning algorithm based on RNN. GraphSense can make each node discover more valuable neighbors through the self-aware neighborhood aggregation algorithm in each epoch. The algorithm employs gated recurrent unit to dynamically aggregate the information of node neighbors to learn the high-order information. Next, in order to capture the temporal properties of graph structures, we employ dynamic graph structure learning algorithm based on RNN to replicate the time evolution process of dynamic graphs. Finally, we evaluate the performance of GraphSense on four publicly available datasets by two specific tasks(edge and node classification). The experimental results show that the proposed GraphSense model outperforms the baseline model by 2.0% to 25.0% on the Elliptic dataset, 2.5% to 27.0% on the Bitcoin-alpha dataset, 3.0% to 31.0% on the Bitcoin-otc dataset, and 0.9% to 26.0% on the Reddit dataset in terms of F1 scores.

Existing models commonly combine recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with attention mechanisms, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to capture spatial-temporal correlations of cellular traffic. However, attention mechanisms lack sensitivity to local information; CNNs ignore the interaction among distant regions with similar semantics; GCNs exhibit limitations in exploring high-order (beyond pairwise) spatial correlations. To this end, we develop a hypergraph attention recurrent network (HARN) that exploits locality, semantics, and high-order correlations for cellular traffic prediction. Specifically, we first propose a spatial trend-aware attention to perceive local trends, thus easing the mismatching problem of attention mechanisms. Then, we construct a hypergraph to characterize the interactions between distant regions with similar semantics, and leverage a hypergraph convolution network to extract high-order correlations. More importantly, to extract heterogeneous and varying spatial patterns, we further enhance the hypergraph convolution network by incorporating spatial-temporal representations. Last, extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HARN over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of mean absolute error and root mean square error, with specific improvements of 1.83% and 5.79% on SMS (short message service) dataset, 3.05% and 11.27% on Call dataset, and 1.36% and 1.65% on Internet dataset, respectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cellular traffic prediction; enhanced hypergraph convolution network; spatial trend-aware attention; spatial-temporal correlations","Cellular neural networks; Graph neural networks; Mobile telecommunication systems; Recurrent neural networks; Attention mechanisms; Cellular traffic prediction; Cellulars; Enhanced hypergraph convolution network; Hyper graph; Recurrent networks; Spatial trend-aware attention; Spatial trends; Spatial-temporal correlation; Traffic prediction; Convolutional neural networks","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62402352, U20A20177, 62272348, 62072411, 62372343, 62302225), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2021YFB3101104), the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (No. LR21F020001), Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing and Real-time Industrial System (Wuhan University of Science and Technology) (No. ZNXX2023QN04), and Open Project Funding of the Key Laboratory of Intelligent Sensing System and Security (Hubei University) (No. KLISSS202406), Ministry of Education; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62402352, U20A20177, 62272348, 62072411, 62372343, 62302225); the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2021YFB3101104); the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (No. LR21F020001); Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing and Real-time Industrial System (Wuhan University of Science and Technology) (No. ZNXX2023QN04); and Open Project Funding of the Key Laboratory of Intelligent Sensing System and Security (Hubei University), Ministry of Education (No. KLISSS202406).","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","19324537","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209931258"

However, the existing methods still face two challenges: they fail to capture global interaction patterns between regions and lack consideration for inter-correlations within interaction patterns. To solve these issues, we propose a novel multi-task spatio-temporal fully convolutional model named MSTFCM. First, the model includes the interaction tensor and raster tensor as task inputs, where the interaction tensor extends the raster tensor by incorporating global interaction patterns between regions. Second, a multi-task framework combined spatio-temporal convolutional block was used to learn generalized features and interaction features. A channel spatio-temporal attention is added to adaptively adjust feature weights and capture inter-correlations. To train the MSTFCM, the uncertainty loss was designed as the learnable loss functions, which capture various flow fluctuations, to facilitate multi-task optimization. The proposed model was validated on two real-world traffic datasets collected in Xiamen, China. Experimental results showed that MSTFCM outperformed nine baselines in one-step and multi-step prediction, with slower performance degradation as predicted time intervals and steps increased.

Facial Emotional Recognition (FER) is a significant research area since it has several significant applications such as crime detection, security, government sectors, surveillance, etc. Many researchers have addressed FER and put efforts into improving recognition using various methods such as Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN), Local Binary Pattern Convolutional Neural Networks (LBPCNN) and Micro Expression Recognition (MER). Nevertheless, there is a dearth of better Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for better accuracy of FER. Various methods have already proven their accuracies on datasets such as Fer_2013, CK48 and Legend. There are many challenges such as varying positions of images, illumination and noise etc. are not resolved yet. In this direction, the proposed modified CNN model has a combination of CNN layers to train the model and achieved better training and validation accuracy on datasets. The proposed method has three-fold contributions (1) to propose an efficient CNN model for FER and (2) to train the proposed model on three standard datasets 3) to test on real-time images. The proposed model is trained on three standard datasets (Fer_2013, CK48, and Legend) and achieves significantly higher training accuracy 92.34%, 99.84%, and 89.86%, respectively as compared to previous methods. Furthermore, the model demonstrates impressive generalization ability by achieving even higher test accuracy on real-world images 91.54%, 96.27%, and 87.47%, respectively. Also, the proposed novel CNN model has addressed all current challenges of FER with low computational complexity and prediction of facial expression more efficiently. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convolution Neural Network; Face Detection; Face Emotion Recognition; Face Features; Harr Cascade","Convolution; Deep neural networks; Emotion Recognition; Face recognition; Local binary pattern; Multilayer neural networks; Convolution neural network; Convolutional neural network; Emotion recognition; Emotional recognition; Face emotion recognition; Face features; Faces detection; Facial emotions; Harr cascade; Neural network model; Convolutional neural networks","","","Materials and Energy Research Center","17281431","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203849516"

Although these works have achieved good predictive performance, they have three fundamental limitations. (i) The regional features of traffic flow are not fully utilized; (ii) The discretized spatiotemporal features of traffic flow do not facilitate a full understanding of the actual traffic dynamic features; (iii) There is a lack of a dynamic and continuous features fusion mechanism between traffic regions and nodes. To address these issues, we propose a traffic forecasting model named Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Graph Ordinary Differential Equation Network (HSTGODE). HSTGODE adopts a dual-layer structure to simultaneously process the traffic flow data at traffic regions and nodes. In the traffic region and node layers, the model captures the characteristics of regions and nodes continuously and deeply through spatial–temporal ODE blocks. It effectively solves the problem of over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and understands hierarchical spatial–temporal features better. We propose a fusion mechanism to continuously integrate regional and node features multiple times through an attention mechanism and skip connections. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two real traffic datasets from Xi'an and Jinan in China. The experimental results demonstrate that HSTGODE outperforms some of the current SOTA models. HSTGODE provides new insights into the hierarchical structure of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in traffic forecasting.

Recently, we are witnessing a rising trend that utilizes various deep-learning methods to facilitate cross-domain data fusion in smart cities. To this end, we propose the first survey that systematically reviews the latest advancements in deep learning-based data fusion methods tailored for urban computing. Specifically, we first delve into data perspective to comprehend the role of each modality and data source. Secondly, we classify the methodology into four primary categories: feature-based, alignment-based, contrast-based, and generation-based fusion methods. Thirdly, we further categorize multi-modal urban applications into seven types: urban planning, transportation, economy, public safety, society, environment, and energy. Compared with previous surveys, we focus more on the synergy of deep learning methods with urban computing applications. Furthermore, we shed light on the interplay between Large Language Models (LLMs) and urban computing, postulating future research directions that could revolutionize the field.

Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been exploited to facilitate IoT operations and maximize their potential in modern application scenarios. In particular, the convergence of IoT and AI has led to a new networking paradigm called Intelligent IoT (IIoT), which has the potential to significantly transform businesses and industrial domains. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of IIoT by investigating its significant applications in mobile networks, as well as its associated security and privacy issues. Specifically, we explore and discuss the roles of IIoT in a wide range of key application domains, from smart healthcare and smart cities to smart transportation and smart industries. Through such extensive discussions, we investigate important security issues in IIoT networks, where network attacks, confidentiality, integrity, and intrusion are analyzed, along with a discussion of potential countermeasures. Privacy issues in IIoT networks were also surveyed and discussed, including data, location, and model privacy leakage.

However, some road sections lack fixed detectors, making it difficult to obtain complete traffic state data for the entire city. Thus, through the fusion of data collected from both the fixed and mobile detectors, we propose a novel model framework, a reasoning model based on the multisource causal interpretation graph (MS-CIG), to infer traffic state data for the road sections without detectors. First, a cross-layer random walk strategy is proposed to achieve fusion and embedding of road network topology graphs (constructed by the fixed detector data) and road network logic graphs (constructed by the mobile detector data). Second, the spatial similarity between road sections can be calculated by combining road sections static feature data, Point of Interest (PoI) distribution and embedding features; thereby, a weighted spatiotemporal graph of the road network is constructed. Finally, an interpretive module is combined to provide interpretability analysis for graph-based semi-supervised inference, thereby making the inferred data generated by graph-based semi-supervised more reasonable and accurate. Through the above processing, we are able to obtain the complete traffic state data for the entire city. Experimental evaluations on a real traffic data set demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Explanatory framework; multigraph learning; semi-supervised inference","Embeddings; Graphic methods; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Roads and streets; State estimation; Topology; Adaptation models; Explanatory framework; Features extraction; Multi-graph learning; Predictive models; Road; Semi-supervised; Semi-supervised inference; Supervised inference; Urban areas; Feature extraction","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant (62373325, 6190334, 52072343), in part by the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation under Grant (LY21F030016, LY20E080023, LQ16E080011), and in part by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under Grant 2018M632501.

Recently, graph contrastive learning (GCL)-based methods have been widely adopted as the mainstream for GAD with remarkable success. However, existing GCL strategies in GAD mainly focus on node-node and node-subgraph contrast and fail to explore subgraph-subgraph level comparison. Furthermore, the different sizes or component node indices of the sampled subgraph pairs may cause the ""nonaligned""issue, making it difficult to accurately measure the similarity of subgraph pairs. In this article, we propose a novel subgraph-aligned multiview contrastive approach for graph anomaly detection, named SAMCL, which fills the subgraph-subgraph contrastive-level blank for GAD tasks. Specifically, we first generate the multiview augmented subgraphs by capturing different neighbors of target nodes forming contrasting subgraph pairs. Then, to fulfill the nonaligned subgraph pair contrast, we propose a subgraph-aligned strategy that estimates similarities with the Earth mover's distance (EMD) of both considering the node embedding distributions and typology awareness. With the newly established similarity measure for subgraphs, we conduct the interview subgraph-aligned contrastive learning module to better detect changes for nodes with different local subgraphs. Moreover, we conduct intraview node-subgraph contrastive learning to supplement richer information on abnormalities. Finally, we also employ the node reconstruction task for the masked subgraph to measure the local change of the target node. Finally, the anomaly score for each node is jointly calculated by these three modules. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with significant performance gains (up to 6.36% improvement on ACM).

Geographic Information Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) is developing rapidly and has become a hot field of current research. This paper provides a detailed review of the cutting-edge research in GeoAI. Firstly, it clearly defines the scope of GeoAI research in the fields of geographic science and urban spatial science, and categorizes it into three types: symbolic GeoAI, connectionist GeoAI, and behaviorist GeoAI. Then, by introducing the concept of 'semantics' and based on the semantic types extracted by models, it further classifies these three logical approaches of GeoAI research, aiming to deeply explore the research questions, content, and technical methods involved in each classification. On this basis, the article summarizes current research focuses and proposes potentially promising future research directions in the era of large models. Through the study, it is found that symbolic GeoAI can effectively organize static geographic knowledge, dynamic geographic processes, and spatio-temporal urban knowledge; connectionist GeoAI focuses on spatial embedding-based semantic representation and prediction; while behaviorist GeoAI concentrates on assisting spatial plan generation. In practical applications, there are the largest number of connectionist GeoAI studies, which are often used in combination with the other two types of GeoAI in upstream and downstream processes. Overall, GeoAI is increasingly pursuing the integration of multimodal data sources; different types of GeoAI research may share common goals, increasingly requiring the combination of multiple modeling logics to solve problems; and the flexible use of large models as intelligent agents to help solve geographic problems has become a new feasible path. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Foundation Model; Geo big data; GeoAI; Knowledge graph; Place semantics; Research progress","Behavioral research; Big data; Geographic information systems; Intelligent agents; Problem solving; Artificial intelligence research; Foundation models; Geo big data; Geographic information; Geographic information artificial intelligence; Geographics; Knowledge graphs; Place semantics; Research progress; Spatio-temporal; Semantics","Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant No.: 52478049","Hu, S.; Ye, X.; Lin, H.; Guan, Q.","IEEE Computer Society","21610258; 2161024X","9781538622667; 9798350344240; 9781467362283; 9798350309881; 9781467376631; 9781538676196; 9781509062140; 9798331573560","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105018742627"

Numerous spatiotemporal correlations and irregularities pose substantial challenges to this endeavor. Existing methods commonly employ fixed-time granularities and sequence prediction models. However, determining appropriate time granularities is difficult, leading to inaccurate predictions for specific time windows. For example, users might ask: What are the crime hotspots during [12:00-20:00]? To address this issue, we introduce FlexiCrime, a novel event-centric framework for predicting crime hotspots with flexible time intervals. FlexiCrime incorporates a continuous-time attention network to capture correlations between crime events, which learns crime context features, representing general crime patterns across time points and locations. Furthermore, we introduce a type-aware spatiotemporal point process that learns crime-evolving features, measuring the risk of specific crime types at a given time and location by considering the frequency of past crime events. Together, the crime context and evolving features allow us to predict whether an urban area is a crime hotspot given a future time interval. To evaluate FlexiCrime's effectiveness, we conducted experiments using real-world datasets from two cities, covering twelve crime types. The results show that our model outperforms baseline techniques in predicting crime hotspots over flexible time intervals. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attention network; crime prediction; flexible time intervals; spatio-temporal data mining","Continuous time systems; Crime; Spatio-temporal data; Attention network; Complex task; Crime prediction; Flexible time interval; Hotspots; Learn+; Predicting crimes; Spatio-temporal data mining; Time granularities; Time interval; Forecasting","","","IEEE Computer Society","10414347","","ITKEE","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105018377073"

Despite their prevalence in geospatial tasks, neural network models usually assume spatial stationarity, which could limit their performance in the presence of spatial process heterogeneity. By allowing model parameters to vary over space, several approaches have been proposed to incorporate spatial heterogeneity into neural networks. Current geographical weighting approaches, however, are ineffective on graph neural networks, yielding no significant improvement in prediction accuracy. We assume the crux lies in the overfitting risk brought by a large number of local parameters. Accordingly, we propose to model spatial process heterogeneity at the regional level rather than at the individual level, which largely reduces the number of spatially varying parameters. We further develop a heuristic optimization procedure to learn the region partition adaptively in the process of model training. Our proposed spatial-heterogeneity-aware graph convolutional network, named RegionGCN, is applied to the modeling of county-level vote share in the 2016 U.S. presidential election based on socioeconomic attributes. Results show that RegionGCN achieves significant improvement over the basic and geographically weighted GCNs. We also offer an exploratory analysis tool for the spatial variation of nonlinear relationships through ensemble learning of regional partitions from RegionGCN. Our work contributes to the practice of geospatial artificial intelligence in tackling spatial heterogeneity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","24694460; 24694452","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105017406982"

Geospatial analysis has proved to be an effective tool in identifying crime patterns and hotspot areas. This work used geospatial analysis for crime prevention by exploring the different techniques, such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), spatial clustering methods, and hot spot analysis. Objective: To utilize GIS, spatial clustering, and hotspot analysis for mapping crime data, identifying high-risk areas, and uncovering underlying factors contributing to concentrated criminal activity. Methods: The framework involves six stages: data collection, spatial pre-processing, clustering (DBSCAN, KDE), deep learning-based forecasting (CNN, LSTM, and ConvLSTM), model evaluation (RMSE, accuracy, F1-score), and Web-GIS visualization. Crime data from open sources was enriched with spatial features, processed using GIS tools, and used to train and validate forecasting models on spatiotemporal patterns. Results and conclusion: The findings demonstrated that the deep learning-enhanced spatial model effectively captured complex crime dynamics. ConvLSTM achieved the highest accuracy in forecasting future crime incidents, with an F1-score of 0.87, outperforming baseline models. Spatial clustering provided high overlap with known historical hotspots, validating the reliability of unsupervised hotspot detection.

Existing approaches often address these dimensions in isolation, neglecting their critical interdependencies. In this paper, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Unitized Model (STUM), a unified framework designed to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies while addressing spatio-temporal heterogeneity through techniques such as distribution alignment and feature fusion. It also ensures both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Central to STUM is the Adaptive Spatio-temporal Unitized Cell (ASTUC), which utilizes low-rank matrices to seamlessly store, update, and interact with space, time, as well as their correlations. Our framework is also modular, allowing it to integrate with various spatio-temporal graph neural networks through components such as backbone models, feature extractors, residual fusion blocks, and the predictor to collectively enhance forecasting outcomes. Experimental results across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that STUM consistently improves prediction performance with minimal computational cost.

Rapid and accurate identification of potential cyber finance fraud can effectively prevent these crimes from occurring. This paper employs ensemble machine learning techniques to analyze abnormal transaction behavior data, aiming to uncover the characteristics of cyber finance fraud facilitation behaviors. It specifically focuses on clarifying the key types of cybercrime facilitation and constructing a robust model to identify these malicious activities. Based on case information from a financial investigation department in China and original bank transaction data, the dataset includes comprehensive information from individuals, banks, and regulatory agencies, enabling an in-depth analysis of cybercrime facilitation behaviors. After evaluating a range of algorithms, including Naive Bayes, SVM, MLP, Random Forests, LightGBM, and XGBoost, we found that SMOTE-XGBoost provided superior performance. The accuracy of the SMOTE-XGBoost model increased from 90.17% to 92.25%, highlighting its enhanced classification capability, while the recall rate rose from 90.17% to 93.05%, indicating improved sensitivity in detecting actual fraudulent transactions and effectively capturing more fraud cases. Additionally, by employing the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) interpretable machine learning method, we can quantify the influence of synthetic samples and various feature data on model decisions. This approach enables effective global and local explanations of the model, thereby increasing its credibility and transparency.

Typical dynamic ST data includes trajectory data (representing individual-level mobility) and traffic state data (representing population-level mobility). Traditional studies often treat trajectory and traffic state data as distinct, independent modalities, each tailored to specific tasks within a single modality. However, real-world applications, such as navigation apps, require joint analysis of trajectory and traffic state data. Treating these data types as two separate domains can lead to suboptimal model performance. Although recent advances in ST data pre-training and ST foundation models aim to develop universal models for ST data analysis, most existing models are 'multi-task, solo-data modality' (MTSM), meaning they can handle multiple tasks within either trajectory data or traffic state data, but not both simultaneously. To address this gap, this paper introduces BIGCity, a pioneer multi-task, multi-data modality (MTMD) model for ST data analysis. The model targets two key challenges in designing an MTMD ST model: (1) unifying the representations of different ST data modalities, and (2) unifying heterogeneous ST analysis tasks. To overcome the first challenge, BIGCity introduces a novel ST-unit that represents both trajectories and traffic states in a unified format. Additionally, for the second challenge, BIGCity adopts a tunable large model with ST task-oriented prompt, enabling it to perform a range of heterogeneous tasks without the need for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that BIGCity achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 tasks, outperforming 17 baselines.

The approach begins by extracting deep semantic representations from social media text using LLama, followed by adversarial training to enhance robustness and classification accuracy against deceptive messages. To address the spread of phishing content, a social network propagation graph is constructed, and the diffusion process is simulated using an influence-based model. A targeted intervention strategy is then introduced to disrupt high-risk propagation paths. To achieve a balanced performance, the framework employs a joint optimization objective that integrates semantic classification loss, adversarial loss, and propagation control loss. Experiments on real-world Twitter data show that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, demonstrating strong detection capabilities and effective intervention. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","LLama model; Phishing attacks; propagation control; social platforms","Belief propagation; Classification (of information); Computer crime; Phishing; Semantic Web; Social networking (online); Text processing; Content detection; Dissemination controls; Language model; Llama model; Phishing attacks; Propagation control; Semantic representation; Social media; Social platform; Unified framework; Semantics","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9798331543303","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014910097"

However, mobile signaling data often exhibits notable data quality issues caused by systematic factors (e.g., weather, construction, congestion) or individual factors (e.g., low battery, poor reception). Improving the quality of signaling data is a crucial yet challenging task due to irregular spatiotemporal intervals and complex inter-correlations among base stations. In this paper, we formalize the augmentation of signaling data as a base station location reconstruction task. We propose a location-aware transformer structure named SigFormer, which employs self-supervised learning to reconstruct the location information of missing base stations based on the sampled signaling sequence. Specifically, we first design a Continuous Signaling Encoder to model irregularly sampled signaling sequences and encode interval information generated by base station transitions. Then, we learn the Base Station Embedding to describe implicit features of base stations and design a Neighbor Region Encoder to incorporate geographic information as an auxiliary for base station representations. Finally, through an attention-based encoder-decoder framework, we aggregate location information and base station features, employing sequence learning to capture spatiotemporal dependencies and reconstruct base station locations. Experiment results on real-world datasets indicate that our method outperforms existing approaches for location reconstruction. The proposed method originates from practical demands in telecom systems, addressing the challenge of missing and abnormal base station locations by modeling spatiotemporal transition patterns in signaling data. Our approach supports various tasks in practical applications, including imputing missing base station locations and correcting anomalous locations, effectively improving the quality of signaling data. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Continuous Signaling Encoding; Location-aware Transformer; Missing Location Imputation; Mobile Signaling Data Augmentation","Data quality; Encoding (symbols); Location; Machine learning; Self-supervised learning; Signal encoding; Signaling; Base station location; Continuous signaling encoding; Data augmentation; Encodings; Fine grained; Location information; Location-aware; Location-aware transformer; Missing location imputation; Mobile signaling data augmentation; Base stations","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15361233","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013858920"

However, urban environments are constantly evolving, and current model evaluations are often limited to traffic scenarios and use data mainly collected only a few weeks after training period to evaluate model performance. The generalization ability of these models remains largely unexplored. To address this, we propose a Spatiotemporal Out-of-Distribution (ST-OOD) benchmark, which comprises six urban scenario: bike-sharing, 311 services, pedestrian counts, traffic speed, traffic flow, ride-hailing demand, and bike-sharing, each with in-distribution (same year) and out-of-distribution (next years) settings. We extensively evaluate state-of-the-art spatiotemporal models and find that their performance degrades significantly in out-of-distribution settings, with most models performing even worse than a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Our findings suggest that current leading methods tend to over-rely on parameters to overfit training data, which may lead to good performance on in-distribution data but often results in poor generalization. We also investigated whether dropout could mitigate the negative effects of overfitting. Our results showed that a slight dropout rate could significantly improve generalization performance on most datasets, with minimal impact on in-distribution performance.

While much effort has been invested in this field, most of the existing studies pay little attention to the influence of situational contexts on criminal activities, which hinders further improvement in prediction performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel context-aware Bayesian tensor decomposition framework, namely cBTD-Crime, for citywide multi-step crime prediction. More specifically, cBTD-Crime first constructs a third-order tensor to simultaneously model spatial, temporal, and contextual factors and then applies the CP decomposition to exploit the intricate relationships between the three factors to facilitate the prediction process. To reduce the parameter tuning cost, cBTD-Crime further reformulates the problem from a probabilistic perspective, where a range of carefully selected distributions are placed on the spatial, temporal, and contextual latent factors. Finally, an efficient Gibbs sampling procedure is developed to generate a series of samples and the arithmetic mean is computed to obtain the predicted number of crime incidents. Experimental results show that cBTD-Crime achieves superior performance on real-world crime datasets in terms of different evaluation metrics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayesian learning; Crime prediction; situational context; tensor decomposition","Bayesian networks; Crime; Decomposition; Prediction models; Sampling; Security systems; Tensors; Bayesian; Bayesian learning; Context-Aware; Crime prediction; Criminal activities; Multisteps; Situational context; Spatial temporals; Surveillance systems; Tensor decomposition; Forecasting","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 72172057, Grant 72301144, and Grant U2468207; in part by Sichuan Science and Technology Program under Grant 2025YFHZ0124; in part by the Key Scientific Research and Innovationof Nanjing University of Finance and Economics (NUFE) under Grant XKYC2202303; in part by the Natural Science Foundation of the Higher Education Institutions of Jiangsu Province under Grant 21KJB520034; and in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant 2682024CX053.","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15566013","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012239390"

Federated Learning (FL) has proven to be a promising privacy-enhancing method for collaborative intrusion detection, allowing distributed clients to train models without exchanging raw data. Yet, FL is susceptible to adversarial attacks, such as model poisoning, backdoor attacks, and Byzantine failures, that can severely compromise detection performance. In this work, we introduce FedDefender, a new Federated Adversarial Learning (FAL) framework that improves the robustness of FL-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) against adversarial attacks in IoT networks. Our solution combines adversarial training, anomaly-aware aggregation, and blockchain-based client reputation scoring to identify and counter malicious model updates. We propose a hybrid Transformer + Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based IDS that utilizes sequential attack behavior modeling and graph-based traffic pattern learning. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark cybersecurity datasets (CICIDS2017, BoT-IoT, and TON_IoT) show that FedDefender is up to 30% more adversarially robust and 20% more effective in detecting zero-day attacks than state-of-the-art FL-based IDS.

As a result, the efficient allocation of public security resources based on spatio-temporal crime prediction models has become a critical concern for urban management. To this purpose, many crime forecasting approaches first split city territories into partitions based on crime rates and trends, with each partition reflecting criminal dynamics of its specific area. Then, crime forecasting models are extracted for each area, to monitor and predict how crime rates evolve over time within each partition. However, traditional spatial partitioning approaches, which divide cities into predefined police districts based on geographic and operational considerations, often fail to account for variations in crime patterns. In contrast, machine learning-based approaches could dynamically adapt to areas with differing crime frequencies and densities, making them particularly effective in cities characterized by diverse population distributions and crime activity levels. This study examines the impact of various partitioning techniques on crime forecasting performance, comparing the traditional static division of the city into police districts with machine learning approaches, specifically density clustering algorithms, for detecting crime hotspots. The experimental evaluation, conducted on two real-world case studies, i.e. Chicago and Los Angeles crime data, demonstrates the effectiveness of density-based clustering in identifying multi-density crime hotspots. Compared to traditional police district partitioning, these data-driven methods offer significant advantages in improving crime forecasting accuracy across urban environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","crime data mining; Crime forecasting; crime hotspots; multi-density clustering; regression analysis; smart cities; smart cities","Clustering algorithms; Crime; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Population statistics; Urban planning; Crime data mining; Crime forecasting; Crime hotspot; Criminal activities; Density clustering; Hotspots; Machine-learning; Multi-density clustering; Public safety; Urban environments; Regression analysis; Smart city","This work was supported in part by the Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza (PNRR) Italian Ministry of University and Research (MUR) Project\""PE0000013-FAIR, ICSC National Centre for HPC, Big Data, and Quantum Computing\""with the NextGenerationEU Program CN00000013, European Union-NextGenerationEU-National Recovery and Resilience Plan, PNRR-Project: SoBigData.it-Strengthening the Italian RI for Social Mining and Big Data Analytics\""IR0000013-n. 3264, Research Project INSIDER: INtelligent ServIce Deployment for advanced cloud-Edge integRation\""grant funded by MUR within the PRIN 2022 Program and European Union-Next Generation EU 2022WWSCRR, CUP H53D23003670006","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011870404"

This paper addresses the challenge of modeling the complex spatial and temporal dependencies inherent in wind power generation by presenting a comprehensive survey of existing spatiotemporal forecasting methods and introducing an innovative deep learning approach. The proposed model integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to represent wind turbines as nodes within a graph, capturing spatial relationships, while a Deep Equilibrium Model (DEQ) enables equilibrium-based inference to handle highly nonlinear wind patterns. A Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture further manages temporal dependencies. The method was validated using a real-world dataset of wind power generation, outperforming baseline models across multiple forecast horizons and maintaining stable accuracy across short- and mid-term predictions. Results demonstrate that the proposed GNN with DEQ effectively models both spatial and temporal dynamics for Seq2Seq data, improving prediction accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

We begin by defining HBA, tracing its historical roots, and outlining core concepts such as behavioral patterns, cognitive processes, and emotional states. The survey then explores traditional and modern techniques, from manual observation to AI-driven methods such as deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. A key contribution is our extensive coverage of HBA applications in healthcare, marketing, education, workplace productivity, activity recognition, and criminal justice. For each domain, we provide detailed examples of how HBA enhances outcomes and decision-making.

Urban computing methods, particularly those leveraging graph representation learning techniques developed over the past decade, provide great potential in advancing urban management planning. In this paper, we adopt the perspective that cities can be effectively represented as network-structured graphs, wherein locations such as buildings and amenities are interconnected through road networks. These urban networks are further partitioned into subgraphs, and we introduce a novel model designed to learn effective representations of these subgraphs as distinct urban areas by utilizing heterogeneous graph neural networks. Specifically, our contributions include: firstly, developing a graph representation learning model that captures the geospatial characteristics of urban locations within dynamically-sized graphs; secondly, implementing an innovative graph pooling-based Graph Convolution Network; and finally, establishing a new benchmark for urban location representation learning tailored to urban management and planning tasks. Experimental results on various graph types demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing methods in graph representation learning, particularly in applications involving urban location analysis for public safety and dense, heterogeneous social media networks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","graph convolution network; graph representatino learing; urban computing","Benchmarking; Graph neural networks; Graph theory; Graphic methods; Information management; Learning systems; Motor transportation; Urban planning; Data-driven approach; Engineering data; Graph convolution network; Graph representatino learing; Graph representation; Heterogeneous graph; Subgraphs; Urban computing; Urban locations; Urban management; Convolution; Location","This work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation via grants IIS-2348443 and ITE-2431845.

The presence of weakly labeled data and the substantial size of models hinder the widespread application of existing methods in real-world situations, particularly on edge devices with limited resources. This article introduces a lightweight anomaly detection system for videos with a novel spatio–temporal attention module in a weakly-supervised environment. With binary-level annotation of videos, the system’s task is to identify abnormal behaviour from video frames. Existing works focus more on strange objects in the videos. The infrequent occurrence of abnormal events and diversity in daily activities poses challenges in such systems. Exploring the frames in a video for the salient and discriminative features is crucial in focusing and identifying critical areas in a frame. This article explores the spatial and temporal characteristics of a video for the detection of abnormal behaviour. More specifically, we put forward a spatio-temporal attention mechanism to extricate the relevant features and identify the abnormal and normal snippets. The dual attention module is designed to be lightweight with a few numbers of trainable parameters. We also design a weighted loss to enhance the discriminative representation between the abnormal and normal segments. An extensive series of demonstrations conducted on large datasets such as UCF-Crime, ShanghaiTech and XD-violence shows that the proposed system has the potential to attain improved performance with an AUC of 84.98%, 95.32%, and 74.05%, respectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Intelligent video surveillance; spatial attention; temporal attention; video anomaly detection (VAD); weakly supervised; weighted loss","Labeled data; Network security; Security systems; Video analysis; Video recording; Abnormal behavior; Anomaly detection; Intelligent video surveillance; Spatial attention; Spatio-temporal; Temporal attention; Video anomaly detection; Video contents; Weakly supervised; Weighted loss","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2329924X","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010945910"

This framework employs hybrid algorithms, including neural networks, decision trees, and ensemble approaches, to analyze the complex relationship between geographic distribution and crime patterns. By leveraging diverse geo-spatial data from satellite imagery, census reports, and crime statistics, the framework uncovers meaningful correlations that enable accurate crime rate predictions. Advanced machine learning models provide precise crime hotspot detection with an 88% accuracy rate and urban growth predictions with a 92% success rate, showcasing robust analytical capabilities for crime trend assessment in both settings. Experimental evaluations on real-world data from metropolitan and rural regions validate the framework's reliability and scalability. The combination of spatio-temporal analysis with interconnected datasets ensures applicability to both urban and rural safety management. Designed to offer actionable insights, this framework supports policymakers and law enforcement agencies in implementing targeted crime prevention strategies tailored to urban and rural contexts.

However, this task is challenging due to the complex spatiotemporal dependencies between regions. Most methods learn spatial representations without considering spatially skewed distributions, where data from the different regions often exhibit long-tailed distributions, limiting the spatial representation capabilities of the tail distribution regions. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel Multi-level Cross-view Graph Convolution Network (MCG-STNet) for spatiotemporal prediction. The core advantage of MCG-STNet is its ability to jointly capture non-Euclidean dependencies from global and local views while enhancing the spatial feature representation of tail distribution regions through an adaptive cross-view information transfer network. Specifically, we design a fuzzy neural network-based soft clustering approach to capture the functional relationships of regions with long-tail distributed data in the global view, integrating domain expertise to capture spatial dependencies among regional functionalities representations adaptively. We propose an adaptive cross-view information transfer network, allowing for the adaptive extraction of supplementary spatial feature representations from global to local view. Experimental results on five real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed MCG-STNet outperforms other baselines. Further analysis validates the insights into the effectiveness of MCG-STNet. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cross-view; long-tailed distributions; spatiotemporal prediction","Data communication systems; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Public health; Spatial distribution; Cross-view; Feature representation; Information transfers; Long-tailed distributions; Multilevels; Spatial features; Spatial representations; Spatio-temporal prediction; Tail distribution; Transfer network; Convolution","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","02714310","9780780388345; 9781467357609; 9781424438280; 9517212402; 0780354710; 9780780354722; 9780780312814; 9781538648810; 0780393902; 0780354729","PICSD","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010622421"

Exploring synthetic, correlation-based scenarios using changes in a set of variables could alter a region’s definition from unsafe to safe (known counterfactual explanation), which can aid decision-makers in interpreting crime in that region and define public policies to mitigate criminal activity. We propose CounterCrime, a visual analytics tool for crime analysis that uses counterfactual explanations to add insights for this problem. This tool employs various interactive visual metaphors to explore the counterfactual explorations generated in each region. To facilitate exploration, we organize our analysis at three levels: the whole city, the region group, and the regional level. This work proposes a new perspective in crime analysis by creating “what-if” scenarios and allowing decision-makers to anticipate changes that would make a region safer. The tool guides the user in selecting variables with the most significant effect in all city regions. Using a greedy strategy, the system recommends the best variables that may influence crime in unsafe regions as the user explores. Our tool allows for identifying the most appropriate counterfactual explorations at the regional level by grouping them by similarity and determining their feasibility by comparing them with existing examples in other regions. Using crime data from São Paulo, Brazil, we validated our results with case studies. These case studies reveal interesting findings; for example, scenarios that influence crime in a particular unsafe region (or set of regions) might not influence crime in other unsafe regions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Counterfactual Explanations; Crime Analysis; Machine Learning; Visual Analytics Tools","Crime; Decision making; Public policy; Visual analytics; Visualization; Analytic tools; Case-studies; Counterfactual explanation; Counterfactuals; Crime analyze; Decision makers; Machine-learning; Regional levels; Visual analytic tool; Learning systems; article; Brazil; crime; crime prevention; data analysis; human; offender","This work was supported in part by the Funda\u00E7\u00E3o de Amparo \u00E0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00E3o Paulo (FAPESP) under Grant 2022/09091-8 and Grant 2021/07012-0, in part by the Funda\u00E7\u00E3o de Amparo \u00E0 Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) under Grant E-26/204.593/2024, in part by the Funda\u00E7\u00E3o Getulio Vargas, in part by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00EDfico e Tecnol\u00F3gico (CNPq) under Grant 307184/2021-8 and Grant 311144/2022-5, and in part by PROCIENCIA under Grant PE501087483-2024.

The conventional approaches typically focus on separate tasks such as trajectory prediction, imputation, or spatial-temporal recovery. Considering the unique formulation and constraint of each task, most existing methods are tailored for only one, limiting the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, which is a common requirement in real-world scenarios. Another limitation is that widely used public datasets mainly focus on pedestrian movements with casual, loosely connected patterns, where interactions between individuals are not always present, especially at a long distance, making them less representative of more structured environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Unified Trajectory Generation model, UniTraj, that processes arbitrary trajectories as masked inputs, adaptable to diverse scenarios in the domain of sports games. Specifically, we introduce a Ghost Spatial Masking (GSM) module, embedded within a Transformer encoder, for spatial feature extraction. We further extend recent State Space Models (SSMs), known as the Mamba model, into a Bidirectional Temporal Mamba (BTM) to better capture temporal dependencies. Additionally, we incorporate a Bidirectional Temporal Scaled (BTS) module to thoroughly scan trajectories while preserving temporal missing relationships. Furthermore, we curate and benchmark three practical sports datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model. We hope that our work can advance the understanding of human movement in real-world applications, particularly in sports.

Effectively identifying and preventing these fraudulent activities has become a critical research problem. Traditional fraud detection methods typically rely on supervised learning, which requires large amounts of labeled data. However, such data is often difficult to obtain, and the continuous evolution of fraudulent activities further reduces the adaptability and effectiveness of traditional methods. To address this issue, this study proposes an unsupervised e-commerce fraud detection algorithm based on SimCLR. The algorithm leverages the contrastive learning framework to effectively detect fraud by learning the underlying representations of transaction data in an unlabeled setting. Experimental results on the eBay platform dataset show that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional unsupervised methods such as K-means, Isolation Forest, and Autoencoders in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, demonstrating strong fraud detection capabilities. The results confirm that the SimCLR-based unsupervised fraud detection method has broad application prospects in e-commerce platform security, improving both detection accuracy and robustness. In the future, with the increasing scale and diversity of datasets, the model's performance will continue to improve, and it could be integrated with real-time monitoring systems to provide more efficient security for e-commerce platforms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","e-commerce platform; fraud detection; machine learning; SimCLR; Unsupervised learning","Contrastive Learning; Crime; Electronic commerce; Labeled data; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Unsupervised learning; Commerce platforms; Critical researches; Detection methods; E- commerces; E-commerce platform; Fraud detection; Fraudulent transactions; Machine-learning; SimCLR; Unsupervised detection; Real time systems","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9798331542856","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010191957"

This study seeks to identify and evaluate the most promising approaches that can effectively counter IFF and ML in the context of economic stability, ensuring they remain adaptive to constantly evolving threats. Design/methodology/approach-The analysis was conducted on papers from Scopus and Web of Science, both recognized as leading academic databases. The application of screening analysis (1,249 papers) enabled the exclusion of articles not primarily focused on IFF and ML. In comparison, thematic synthesis (1,135 papers) facilitated the presentation of the current state of literature, highlighting main trends and categorizing articles by thematic dimensions. Textual narrative synthesis (234 papers) allows the identification of existing methods and the variables and proxies used in the literature to detect and estimate IFF and ML. Findings-The analysis reveals that a multidisciplinary approach to IFF and ML, integrating law, social sciences, and computer science, holds promise. The study emphasizes innovative methodologies, like machine learning, alongside gravity-based models. Specifically, 38% of the literature focuses on systematizing knowledge, while advanced techniques like machine learning (26%) and modified gravity-based models (3.33%) are increasingly influential. Legal and economic approaches provide a broad framework for understanding illicit activities and identifying emerging threats and trends among the methods used by criminals. Challenges remain in measuring and detecting IFF/ML due to the secretive nature of such flows. Research implications/limitations-This review summarizes IFF and ML detection/estimation techniques, including research up to 2024. Limitations include potential source selection bias (WOS/Scopus) and the exclusion of 81 studies due to access restrictions. Future research should refine source selection and improve access to critical literature.

Unlike conventional time series forecasting, CP faces unique difficulties due to the inherent sparsity of crime incidents, particularly within small spatial regions and limited time windows. This sparsity, coupled with the non-Gaussian distribution of crime data—characterized by an excess of zero events and over-dispersion—presents a critical challenge for the signal processing community. In this regard, we propose a novel framework, Spatial-Temporal Multivariate Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Graph Neural Networks (STMGNN-ZINB), which integrates diffusion and convolutional graph networks to capture spatial, temporal, and multivariate dependencies. By leveraging a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial distribution, the STMGNN-ZINB effectively models the over-dispersed and zero-heavy nature of crime data, significantly improving both prediction accuracy and confidence interval estimation. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our STMGNN-ZINB outperforms state-of-the-art CP methods, offering a robust tool for crime early warning and explicable insights into urban crime dynamics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","crime prediction; graph neural networks; spatial-temporal signal; Time series","Computer crime; Convolutional neural networks; Crime; Forecasting; Information systems; Signal processing; Crime data; Crime prediction; Graph neural networks; Personal safety; Spatial temporals; Spatial-temporal signals; Time series forecasting; Times series; Uncertainty; Zero-inflated; Time series","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","07367791; 15206149","1424407281; 9781467300469; 0780362934; 9781457705397; 9781728163277; 9781424423545; 9798350368741; 0780305329; 9780780309463; 9781509066315","IPROD","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009593338"

The insights gained from police department records can be used to understand criminal behavior, predict crime hotspots, forecast criminal events, prevent crime activity, and ultimately foster safer communities. Recently, there has been a growing interest in developing and applying deep learning (DL) models for crime forecasting by leveraging neural network architectures to identify key spatiotemporal dependencies and patterns shared across different crime series. However, these models often struggle to capture local topological information and higher-order interactions within both spatial and temporal domains. Additionally, they fail to fully leverage multi-modal data, limiting their ability to uncover hidden relationships among different crime incidents. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Large Language Model-Based Zigzag Graph Neural Networks (LLM-ZGNNs) for highly efficient and effective spatiotemporal crime forecasting. More specifically, to integrate time-aware topological information into the DL architecture, we introduce the multi-zigzag topological tensor using zigzag persistent homology. We also utilize the LLM with a carefully designed prompt to enhance the visual knowledge extraction from satellite images to improve performance in predicting crime event frequency. Experiments on real-world crime data show LLM-ZGNNs outperforms state-of-the-art models by a significant margin. Additionally, we explore the relationship between homelessness and the criminal justice system by establishing an open knowledge network, addressing the knowledge gap and examining strategies to protect individuals experiencing homelessness from crime. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Graph Learning; Spatio-Temporal Forecasting; Topological Data Analysis","Computer crime; Crime; Deep learning; Knowledge management; Knowledge transfer; Network topology; Graph learning; Graph neural networks; Language model; Model-based OPC; Predicting and analyzing; Public protection; Safety protection; Spatio-temporal forecasting; Topological data analysis; Topological information; Forecasting","This work was supported by the NSF grant TIP-2333703.

Furthermore, data-sharing concerns present a substantial obstacle to the development of a comprehensive FDIA localization framework. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a cloud-edge framework based on split learning for the localization of FDIA in distribution networks. The proposed framework consists of two primary components: the grid edge computing units at the edge, which includes the local feature extractor and the feature classifier, and the cloud where the global feature extractor is located. The local feature extractors in the grid edge computing units at the nodes are tasked with extracting local features from node measurements. The cloud is responsible for deriving global/spatial features from the local features extracted by each grid edge computing unit distributed throughout the network. Lastly, each feature classifier orchestrates the conclusive processing stage to make decisions at the grid edge based on the spatial features extracted by the cloud. Attention layers namely the self-and the spatial attentions, are utilized to focus on the most important features for the local feature extractors and the global feature extractor, respectively. Data-sharing concerns are mitigated as both the raw measurements and the labels are kept at the grid edge. Comparative studies indicate that the proposed framework maintains strong resilience to varying attack strengths and effectively handles noisy measurements. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cyber attack detection; distribution system state estimation; False data injection attack; federated learning; split learning","Cloud security; Computer crime; Data Sharing; Edge computing; Edge detection; Grid computing; Learning systems; Location; Network security; Attack detection; Computing units; Cybe attack detection; Cyber-attacks; Distribution system state estimations; False data injection attacks; Feature extractor; Local feature; Split learning; Electric power distribution","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","19493053","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008437958"

Different regions in the area exhibit different characteristics while having latent correlations. This spatial heterogeneity and correlations greatly affect the spatio-temporal distributions of event occurrences, which has not been addressed by state-of-the-art models. Learning spatial dependencies of events in a continuous space is challenging due to its fine granularity and a lack of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a novel Graph Spatio-Temporal Point Process (GSTPP) model for fine-grained event prediction. It adopts an encoder-decoder architecture that jointly models the state dynamics of spatially localized regions using neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The state evolution is built on the foundation of a novel Self-Adaptive Anchor Graph (SAAG) that captures spatial dependencies. By adaptively localizing the anchor nodes in the space and jointly constructing the correlation edges between them, the SAAG enhances the model’s ability of learning complex spatial event patterns. The proposed GSTPP model greatly improves the accuracy of fine-grained event prediction. Extensive experimental results show that our method greatly improves the prediction accuracy over existing spatio-temporal event prediction approaches. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Forecasting; Spatio-temporal data; Data distributed; Event prediction; Fine grained; Point process; Prediction tasks; Process-models; Spatial dependencies; Spatio-temporal; Spatiotemporal event; Copyrights; Ordinary differential equations","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 62376055 and 62276053.

Machine learning methods can improve the detection performance of network attacks through effective statistical characterization of network traffic, but they tend to ignore network topology and temporal information, thus limiting the detection performance of potential botnet attacks. Graph neural network (GNN) methods are capable of extracting information about network topology and are currently widely used for network intrusion detection. However, most of the GNN-based methods mainly target static graphs or use transductive models that assume the network contains a fixed set of nodes or edges, which cannot cope with dynamic IoT environments. In this article, we propose a hierarchical attention-based dynamic GNN algorithm (HADGA) for botnet detection in dynamic IoT networks. HADGA transforms network traffic into a dynamic graph and decouples spatiotemporal evolution through dual-attention modules. Specifically, we propose a novel joint attention mechanism in the neighbor attention module, which is fused with GraphSAGE to generate spatial embeddings of nodes inductively. The temporal attention module captures the temporal evolution information of network traffic by flexibly weighting the historical representations of nodes. Experiments on BoT-IoT and TON-IoT datasets demonstrate HADGA’s superiority in dynamic IoT networks with variable topologies, achieving 97.6% and 99.9% accuracy, respectively, surpassing Anomal-E by 2.56% and 1.27%. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attention mechanism; botnet detection; dynamic graph; graph neural network (GNN); Internet of Things (IoT)","Bot (Internet); Botnet; Computer crime; Graph embeddings; Graph neural networks; Graph theory; Intrusion detection; Network intrusion; Network security; Network topology; Attention mechanisms; Botnet detections; Botnets; Detection performance; Dynamic graph; Network traffic; Neural networks algorithms; Security measure; Internet of things","This work was supported by the Open fund of Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Power Transmission & Distribution Equipment Technology under Grant 2023JSSPD02.","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","23274662","9781728176055","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007995446"

An automated system for anomaly detection and classification can reduce human leverage, cost, and time. We propose a two-stage classifier pipelined within a single model for anomaly detection and classification. The first stage of the two-stage classifier is a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) based binary classifier that determines whether an event is anomalous or normal. Based on the output of the first classifier, if the event is found anomalous, then it goes to the second stage of our single-pipelined model. The second stage classifier is a Vision Transformer (ViT) based architecture that further classifies an anomalous event into specific anomaly categories. This research utilized the UCF Crime dataset. Being quite large, it requires a significant amount of computational resources and time for processing. We also proposed a keyframe extraction algorithm to reduce the computational cost and time. The proposed keyframe extraction algorithm identifies and selects only relevant frames from videos and discards the redundant and irrelevant frames. The proposed methodology combines Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) for spatial-temporal feature extraction from a complex scenario and classify them. The proposed model achieves 98% accuracy for binary classification modules and 95% accuracy for multi-class classification. Furthermore, the proposed keyframe extraction algorithm significantly reduces the processing time and computational resources. For each videos, it requires only 20ms processing time. The outcome of the proposed model suggests that it can outperform traditional methods for anomaly detection and classification. However, a highly correlated and vast amount of data creates problems like overfitting and increases the complexity of the model. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anomaly Detection Classification; CNN; Keyframe Extraction; Transformers (ViT); Vision","Anomaly detection; Image coding; Anomaly detection classification; Computational resources; Computational time; Convolutional neural network; Extraction algorithms; Key-frame extraction; Processing time; Transformer (vision transformer); Two-stage classifiers; Convolutional neural networks","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9798350357509","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007760566"

Accurately classifying encrypted traffic remains challenging, yet it is crucial for enhancing network security and management. Existing methods that rely on pre-trained models often overlook the temporal characteristics of traffic data. We propose a model based on BERT and Recurrent Neural Networks for Encrypted Traffic Classification (BGETC) to address this issue. Our model operates in two phases: The first phase employs a BERT-based pre-training module designed to learn generic traffic representations from large-scale unlabelled encrypted traffic datasets. The second phase involves fine-tuning, where temporal features are incorporated at the output layer of the BERT model using Recurrent Neural Networks. Combining comprehensive features from the BERT model and temporal features significantly enhances performance, exceeding state-of-the-art baselines in several encrypted traffic classification tasks. Our method notably increases the F1 score to 99.39% for ISCX-VPN-App (packet) and 99.40% for USTC-TFC (flow), thereby markedly improving encrypted traffic classification performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BERT; Encrypted Traffic Classification; Recurrent Neural Network","BERT; Classification methods; Continuous development; Encrypted traffic; Encrypted traffic classification; Encryption technologies; Focal points; Neural-networks; Temporal features; Traffic classification; Telecommunication traffic","","Goel, S.; Uzun, E.; Xie, M.; Sarkar, S.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","18678211; 1867822X","9783031969430; 9783031944413; 9783032014719; 9783642039775; 9783031717154; 9783319737119; 9783030955304; 9783642236341; 9783031606649; 9783030164461","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007227396"

Current models, while efficient, often struggle with tasks beyond their initial training due to limited flexibility. Typically, new tasks require developing specialized models, which may not perform optimally with limited data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the development of a universal pretrained model that understands a city’s various aspects comprehensively. This model serves as a robust foundation, ready to be quickly adjusted for different urban tasks as they arise, even if they occur in different cities. Unlike language models, urban computing models must handle unique spatial-temporal dynamics, making standard pretraining techniques inadequate. Our approach includes a spatial-temporal module with multi-graph convolution and temporal attention mechanisms, capturing the necessary spatial-temporal patterns during pretraining. We also integrate a prompt-tuning module within this framework, which can be adapted for new predictive tasks. The results of extensive experiments on four urban predictive tasks across two cities demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","data limited; spatial-temporal prediction; Urban computing; within and across cities","Data quality; Area efficiency; Data limited; Pre-training; Spatial temporal model; Spatial temporals; Spatial-temporal prediction; Temporal prediction; Urban areas; Urban computing; Within and across city; Urban growth","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15361233","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006589804"

Analyzing the Ethereum transaction network to detect phishing users poses a set of critical challenges, including network sparsity, dynamic network fluctuations, large-scale data and significant class imbalance. Existing literature in this area primarily leverages traditional feature engineering or network representation learning to retrieve crucial information from transaction records to identify suspected users. However, these methods mainly rely on manually handcrafted features or conventional node representation learning while ignoring the inherent network sparsity and dynamic fluctuations. Hence, to alleviate these challenges, this article introduces a novel tensor-based representation learning framework, TREAT (Temporal and Relational Attention-based Tensor Representation Learning). TREAT models the Ethereum transaction network as a 3-dimensional tensor to preserve structural, transactional, and temporal aspects in a standalone architecture, thereby observing the rich correlation among these. The framework is coupled with a two-way self-attention mechanism alongside a rank-based tensor decomposition to comprehend the underlying evolving transaction interaction patterns while addressing the network sparsity. A Graph Neural Network layer with edge attention elevates the final representation quality, thereby yielding a 3%~4% improvement in F1-Score with respect to the existing baselines. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ethereum; phishing; spatiotemporal phenomena; tensors","Graph neural networks; Block-chain; Critical challenges; Cyber-crimes; Dynamic network; Financial loss; Large scale data; Network fluctuations; Phishing; Phishing attacks; Tensor representation","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","19391374","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005198729"

Traditional formulations of point-based SPM tasks are mainly based on true observations, which tend to have limited spatial coverage, availability, and timeliness. While machine learning (ML) has the potential to extend the range of usable data, the uncertainty of model-predicted labels presents new challenges for their usability in the SPM context. This paper formulates the task of ML-enabled SPM using predicted labels by ML models. Given the ever-expanding family of spatial patterns, we consider four widely-adopted patterns–hotspots, co-locations, mixture patterns, and spatial outliers–to scope our study to make the discussion concrete. We develop soft-label versions of SPM algorithms that can directly execute on uncertain predictions generated by ML models. Additionally, we evaluate the ML-enabled SPM results for both categorical and real-valued datasets across a spectrum of prediction quality. The results show that certain spatial patterns such as multinomial scan statistic-based mixture patterns and normal-model-based hotspots can more robustly maintain the detection quality at different error levels, while others such as spatial outliers are more sensitive to incorrect predictions. This provides helpful guidance on using learning-based predictions for SPM. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","evaluation; imperfect labels; Machine learning; pattern mining","algorithm; data mining; detection method; machine learning; pattern recognition; spatial data","Zhili Li is supported in part by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant No. 2105133; Yiqun Xie is supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2105133, 2126474, 2147195, 2425844, and 2430978; Google\u2019s AI for Social Good Impact Scholars program; and the Zaratan cluster at the University of Maryland; Xiaowei Jia is supproted in part by 2147195, 2425845, 2239175, and 2316305, and USGS under Grant No. G21AC10207, G21AC10564, and G22AC00266, Pitt Momentum Funds award and CRC at the University of Pittsburgh.","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","13658824; 13658816","","IGISF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003175312"

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized this field by analyzing vast amounts of data to identify patterns and anticipate criminal activities with unprecedented accuracy. This paper aims to review the literature on AI-based crime prediction, analyzing 142 studies that focus on crimes against individuals, society, and property. Despite the promising potential of AI in crime prediction, significant challenges remain, particularly regarding the trustworthiness of AI systems, which is essential for their social acceptance. To address these issues, this review explores the explainability of AI-based prediction models, with a specific focus on the role of explainable AI (XAI). The findings highlight the importance of XAI in building trust in these models by offering more transparent and interpretable insights into how AI systems make decisions. However, the review also reveals that the integration of XAI remains underdeveloped in the current literature. By improving the transparency of AI systems, XAI has the potential to lead to more accurate, trustworthy, and fair crime predictions, ultimately facilitating more effective and equitable crime prevention efforts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; crime datasets; Crime prediction; explainability; interpretability; survey","Artificial intelligence systems; Crime dataset; Crime prediction; Crime Prevention; Criminal activities; Explainability; Interpretability; Law-enforcement agencies; Prevention strategies; Property; Prediction models","This work was supported in part by the Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza (PNRR)\u2014Missione 4 \u2018\u2018Istruzione e ricerca\u2019\u2019\u2013Componente 2 \u2018\u2018Dalla ricerca all\u2019impresa\u2019\u2019\u2013Investimento 1.3, finanziato dall\u2019Unione europea (M4C2)\u2014Investimento 1.3, Partenariato Esteso\u2014Future Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR)\u2014Spoke 1 \u2018\u2018Human-Centered AI\u2019\u2019 through the NextGeneration European Union (EU) Program under Grant PE00000013; in part by Italian Ministry of University and Research (MUR) in the Framework of FoReLab and CrossLab Projects (Departments of Excellence); and in part by the T\u00C4B\u0130TAK B\u0130DEB 2219\u2014International Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program for Turkish Citizens.","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003087951"

The model integrates Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Spatiotemporal Transformers, and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to achieve effective data fusion, spatiotemporal feature extraction, and real-time decision support. Through experiments conducted on the Los Angeles Crime Data and CrisisLexT26 datasets, this study demonstrates that GATPNet outperforms other baseline models. On the Los Angeles Crime Data dataset, GATPNet achieved an accuracy of 90%, recall of 89%, Spatiotemporal Prediction Accuracy (STPA) of 80%, and a response time of 1.9 s, showing a 5% improvement in accuracy and a 10% improvement in STPA over the best baseline method.

Additionally, ablation experiments further indicate that each module plays a critical role in improving overall performance. Despite the model’s high computational complexity when handling large-scale heterogeneous data and the limited coverage of the datasets, GATPNet still demonstrates its broad application potential in public safety event prediction and management, offering effective technical support for social governance and emergency management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","data integration; deep learning; graph neural networks (GNN); intelligent decision support; multi-source data fusion; public safety event; real-time prediction","Graph neural networks; Prediction models; Deep learning; Graph neural network; Intelligent decision support; Multi-source data fusion; Multi-Sources; Public safety; Public safety event; Real-time prediction; Source data; Data accuracy","The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

The phenomenon of UPD is also undergoing a process of evolution in conjunction with the developments that are taking place in urban areas. Measuring the evolution of UPD remains a challenge, however. This study innovatively employed time-series street view images and deep learning to analyze the temporal evolution of UPD on a nationwide scale, encompassing both overall levels and diverse manifestations. A total of 20 million street view images were collected in China from 2013 to 2022. The YOLOv8 object detection model was trained to accurately identify fourteen UPD elements. Subsequently, each element was assigned a weight to reflect the overall level of UPD. A clustering analysis based on graph neural networks identified four distinct manifestations, which were found to vary considerably across cities: good quality, vacancy and decay, under construction, and poor maintenance. The findings indicate a decrease in the overall level of UPD in China, with the primary issue shifting from poor maintenance to vacancy and decay. Economic growth correlates with overall improvements in UPD, whereas cities experiencing population decline tend to have more vacancies. The approach to measuring the evolution of UPD allows for a more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon and facilitates the prediction of urban space quality challenges, hence assisting urban planners in devising specific strategies for improvement. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","graph neural networks; neighborhood disorder; spatiotemporal changes; street view image; urban space quality","artificial neural network; cluster analysis; detection method; economic growth; machine learning; prediction; temporal evolution; time series; urban planning; China","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [No. 62394331, 62394335, 52178044].","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","24694460; 24694452","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002315374"

By investigating the correlation between multi-order derivative and spatio-temporal data, we propose a generic yet simple plug-in structure, named TaylorS, to improve the performance and generalization of existing forecasting models. The TaylorS converts the non-linear regression problem into a multi-order non-linear approximation problem by plugging a Taylor expansion into the forecasting task. To achieve this, we design a two-step training framework, including a training step and an adjusting step. During training, we train a given forecasting model as a base model to be equipped with prior knowledge. During adjusting, we fine-tune the base model while plugging an adjustment model into the base model. The adjustment model, as a multi-order expansion, takes the multi-order derivative of data to evaluate data uncertainty for further forecasting approximation and adjustment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TaylorS framework can consistently improve the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods and generalize these methods to different forecasting tasks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","forecasting adjustment; framework; Spatio-temporal forecasting; taylor expansion","Adjustment model; Base models; Expansion structures; Forecasting adjustment; Forecasting models; Framework; Multi-ordering; Performance; Spatio-temporal forecasting; Taylor's expansion; Prediction models","2025.

The spatio-temporal graph is a major type of spatio-temporal data with complex structure, spatio-temporal features, and relationships. How to mine key patterns from complex spatio-temporal graph data for various downstream tasks has become the main problem of complex spatio-temporal data mining tasks. Currently, the increasingly mature temporal graph neural networks provide powerful tools for the development of this research field. In addition, the emerging spatio-temporal large models provide a new research perspective based on the existing spatiotemporal graph neural network methods. However, most existing reviews in this field have relatively rough classification frameworks for methods, lack comprehensive and in-depth introduction to complex data types (e.g., dynamic heterogeneous graphs and dynamic hypergraphs), and do not provide a detailed summary of the latest research progress related to spatio-temporal graph large models. Therefore, in this study, the complex spatio-temporal data mining methods based on graph neural networks are divided into spatio-temporal fusion architecture and spatio-temporal large models to introduce them from traditional and emerging perspectives. According to specific complex data types, spatio-temporal fusion architecture is divided into dynamic graphs, dynamic heterogeneous graphs, and dynamic hypergraphs. Moreover, the spatio-temporal large models are divided into time series and graphs according to temporal and spatial dimensions. The latest research related to spatio-temporal graphs is listed in graph-based large models. The core details of multiple key algorithms are introduced, and the pros and cons of different methods are compared.

Moreover, Start utilizes one-hot encoding to differentiate crime types, enabling the model to assign specific attention to individual crime categories. Seasonal trend decomposition using LOESS (STL) is employed to decompose time series into trend, seasonality, and remainder components by effectively capturing residual variations. VAR attention enhances prediction accuracy by focusing on specific crime types and prioritizing relevant information. The proposed approach is evaluated on publicly available crime datasets from New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles and three state-of-the-art evaluation measures: mean error (ME), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean square error (RMSE). Our simulation results demonstrate the significance of the proposed method in enhancing crime prediction accuracy for the most critical crimes compared to state-of-the-art methods. Enhanced crime prediction may help law enforcement agencies allocate resources efficiently by focusing on the most critical areas. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crime prediction; safe society; spatiotemporal; time series analysis; transformers","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2329924X","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001202851"

The implementation of surveillance cameras in public spaces is driven by the specific goal of monitoring incidents involving theft, vandalism, traffic accidents, etc. However, the reliance on human oversight for anomaly detection introduces a susceptibility to errors, emphasizing the urgent need for the development of efficient algorithms capable of autonomously detecting anomalies in video footage. Furthermore, anomalous patterns within video data often have a complex background, unexpected events, variations in the scale of the objects, and anomalous appearances, which makes their detection challenging. Therefore we introduce a novel Dual Stream Transformer Network (TDS-Net) to address these challenges. TDS-Net concurrently extracts RGB and flow features, using a transformer network for sequential pattern learning. The parallel extraction of RGB features allows the model to learn patterns, while the dedicated flow module adeptly handles motion features. The significance of this innovative network for video anomaly detection is that it enhances the ability to identify and analyze unusual patterns or events within video data. Furthermore, the TDS-Net has demonstrated superior accuracy compared to baseline methods across benchmark datasets, including ShanghaiTech, CUHK Avenue, and UCF Crime.

This article presents a video-based traffic analysis and anomaly detection system covering the complete data processing pipeline, including sensor data acquisition, analysis, and digital twin reconstruction. The system solves the challenge of geo-spatial mapping of captured visual data onto the road/intersection topology by semantic analysis of aerial data. Additionally, the automated camera calibration component enables instant camera pose estimation to map traffic agents onto the road/intersection surface accurately. A novel aspect is approaching the anomaly detection problem by AI analysis of both the spatio-temporal visual clues and the geo-spatial trajectories for all type of traffic participants, such as pedestrians, bicyclists, and vehicles. This enables recognition of anomalies related to either traffic-rule violations, for example, jaywalking, improper turns, zig-zag driving, unlawful stops, or behavioural anomalies: littering, accidents, falling, vandalism, violence, infrastructure collapse etc. The method achieves leading anomaly detection results on benchmark datasets World Cup 2014, UCF-Crime, XD-Violence, and ShanghaiTech.

Its role in disseminating news worldwide is significant due to its easy accessibility. However, the increase in the use of these platforms presents severe risks for potentially misleading people. Our research aims to investigate different techniques within machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble learning frameworks in Arabic fake news detection. We integrated FastText word embeddings with various machine learning and deep learning methods. We then leveraged advanced transformer-based models, including BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa, optimizing their performance through careful hyperparameter tuning. The research methodology involves utilizing two Arabic news article datasets, AFND and ARABICFAKETWEETS datasets, categorized into fake and real subsets and applying comprehensive preprocessing techniques to the text data. Four hybrid deep learning models are presented: CNN-LSTM, RNN-CNN, RNN-LSTM, and Bi-GRU-Bi-LSTM. The Bi-GRU-Bi-LSTM model demonstrated superior performance regarding the F1 score, accuracy, and loss metrics. The precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy of the hybrid Bi-GRU-Bi-LSTM model on the AFND Dataset are 0.97, 0.97, 0.98, and 0.98, and on the ARABICFAKETWEETS dataset are 0.98, 0.98, 0.99, and 0.99 respectively. The study’s primary conclusion is that when spotting fake news in Arabic, the Bi-GRU-Bi-LSTM model outperforms other models by a significant margin. It significantly aids the global fight against false information by setting the stage for future research to expand fake news detection to multiple languages. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Ensemble Learning; Fake News Detection; FastText","article; benchmarking; deep learning; disinformation; human; learning; long short term memory network; machine learning; social media; spotting","","","Nature Research","20452322","","","39496680","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208516956"

They provide a close-up perspective of the urban physical environment, allowing a comprehensive perception and understanding of cities. There has been a significant amount of effort to represent the urban physical environment based on street view imagery, and this representation has been utilized to study the relationships between the physical environment, human dynamics, and socioeconomic environments. However, there are two key challenges in representing the urban physical environment of streets based on street-view images for downstream tasks. First, current research mainly focuses on the proportions of visual elements within the scene, neglecting the spatial adjacency between them. Second, the spatial dependency and spatial interaction between streets have not been adequately accounted for. These limitations hinder the effective representation and understanding of urban streets. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic graph representation framework based on dual spatial semantics. At the intra-street level, we consider the spatial adjacency relationships of visual elements. Our method dynamically parses visual elements within the scene, achieving context-specific representations. At the inter-street level, we construct two spatial weight matrices by integrating the spatial dependency and the spatial interaction relationships. It could account for the hybrid spatial relationships between streets comprehensively, enhancing the model's ability to represent human dynamics and socioeconomic status. Furthermore, aside from these two modules, we also provide a spatial interpretability analysis tool for downstream tasks.

Few studies systematically measure the nightscape from a human perspective. This study brings a new paradigm — urban lighting sensing via Nighttime Street View Imagery (SVI). The paradigm draws on the accomplishments of (daytime) SVI and gives attention to its ignored nighttime counterpart. We put forward this idea by manually collecting 2,831 nighttime SVIs across various urban functional areas in Singapore. We investigated their values by developing a use case for clustering nighttime lighting patterns. To mitigate the scarcity of nighttime SVI, deep learning regression models were trained to predict nighttime brightness based on corresponding daytime SVIs obtained from widely available sources. The results were compared with brightness data derived from satellite imagery, to affirm the novelty and uniqueness of nighttime SVI. As a result, there are 7 lighting patterns within the collected nighttime SVI, distinct in lighted spot features and total brightness. The identified patterns effectively characterize different urban function scenarios. The best trained brightness prediction model performs well in revealing the city-scale lighting landscape. The SVI-predicted brightness shows a distribution similar to the brightness from satellite imagery and complements it in urban areas with complex vertical lighting structures. This study demonstrates the potential of nighttime SVI as a valuable data source for mapping urban lighting and activities, offering advantages over satellite data. The proposed paradigm contributes significantly to cross-modal information mining in urban studies and has potential applications in scenarios such as light pollution mitigation and crime prevention. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","GeoAI; Social sensing; Urban analytics; Urban informatics; Urban infrastructure; Urban lighting","Functional areas; GeoAI; Human perspectives; Lighting patterns; Night time lights; Social sensing; Urban analytic; Urban Informatics; Urban infrastructure; Urban lighting; Satellite imagery; artificial intelligence; informatics; infrastructure; remote sensing; satellite imagery; urban area; Singapore [Singapore (NTN)]; Singapore [Southeast Asia]","We thank our colleagues at the NUS Urban Analytics Lab for the discussions.

By leveraging the expressive power of MSOTL within a hypergraph context, our approach enables a more nuanced representation of temporal and relational data, leading to improved predictive accuracy and deeper analytical insights.

Although urban morphology (UM) has been applied to traffic networks, there exists a lack of multiscale quantitative research on TPN. From the UM perspective, this paper develops a quantitative framework to achieve the extraction and analysis of multimorphological features of TPNs on spatiotemporal scales. Subsequently, we investigated the morphological evolution of TPNs in Nanjing, China, from the 1980s to the 2020s. The research reveals the following findings: (1) In terms of spatiotemporal scales, the Nanjing TPN exhibits a multicentric agglomeration pattern on a smaller scale, evolving from discrete points to urban belts; on a larger scale, the urban framework transitions from a cross-shaped axis to a circular radial form. The evolution of Nanjing's form zones shows a southward shift of the Core zone and a transition from agglomeration to expansion and then gradual stabilization in the periphery of the Core zone. (2) The quantitative framework we proposed effectively extracts morphological characteristics within TPNs, visualizing the focal points and trends in urban traffic planning. (3) These morphological characteristics create Nanjing's heart-shaped layout, also reflecting the evolution of planning concepts from concentric urban groups to urban-rural integration. Our study enriches research on traffic planning and UM and offers valuable insights for traffic planning in Chinese cities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Morphological evolution; Nanjing; Space Syntax; Spatiotemporal scale; Traffic network planning; Urban morphology","Highway planning; Street traffic control; Urban transportation; Morphological evolution; Nanjing; Network planning; Planning networks; Space syntax; Spatio-temporal scale; Traffic network planning; Traffic networks; Traffic planning; Urban morphology; Urban growth; agglomeration; spatiotemporal analysis; traffic management; urban morphology; urban planning; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42071172).","","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)","07339488","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201734349"

Although the majority of advances in GFL have been focused on techniques for elucidating the intricate relationships among clients, existing GFL methods have two limitations. First, current methods comprising the use of low-dimensional graphs fail to accurately depict the associations between clients, thereby compromising the performance of GFL. Second, these methods may disclose additional information when sharing client-side hidden representations. This paper presents a structural GFL (SGFL) framework and a suite of novel optimization methods. SGFL addresses the limitations of existing GFL approaches with three original contributions. Firstly, our approach advocates the dynamic construction of federated learning (FL) graphs by leveraging the high-dimensional information inherent among clients, while enabling the discovery of hierarchical communities within clients. Secondly, we present SG-FedX, a novel federated stochastic gradient optimization algorithm that mitigates the effects of heterogeneity by intelligently using a global representation. Furthermore, SG-FedX introduces a strict sharing mechanism that protects client privacy more effectively by refraining from sharing client information beyond the model parameters. Our comparative evaluations, conducted against ten representative FL algorithms under challenging non-independently-and-identically-distributed settings, demonstrated the superior performance of SG-FedX. It was noted that, in the cross-dataset scenarios, SG-FedX outperformed the second-best baseline by 8.12% and 7.91% in personalization and generalization performance, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Federated learning; Graph; High-dimensional information; Structured entropy","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Differential privacy; Graph; High-dimensional; High-dimensional information; Higher-dimensional; Learning methods; Performance; Recent progress; Statistical heterogeneities; Structural graph; Structured entropy; Federated learning","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 62102445 and 62002369 , in part by the Postgraduate Scientific Research Innovation Project of Hunan Province under Grant XJCX2023013 .","","Elsevier B.V.","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203539452"

However, existing spatiotemporal deep learning mostly focuses on deterministic prediction, overlooking the inherent uncertainty in such prediction. Particularly, highly-granular spatiotemporal datasets are often sparse, posing extra challenges in prediction and uncertainty quantification. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel post-hoc Sparsity-aware Uncertainty Calibration (SAUC) framework, which calibrates uncertainty in both zero and non-zero values. To develop SAUC, we firstly modify the state-of-the-art deterministic spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) to probabilistic ones in the pre-calibration phase. Then we calibrate the probabilistic ST-GNNs for zero and non-zero values using quantile approaches. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that SAUC can effectively fit the variance of sparse data and generalize across two real-world spatiotemporal datasets at various granularities. Specifically, our empirical experiments show a 20% reduction in calibration errors in zero entries on the sparse traffic accident and urban crime prediction. Overall, this work demonstrates the theoretical and empirical values of the SAUC framework, thus bridging a significant gap between uncertainty quantification and spatiotemporal prediction. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Calibration Methods; Graph Neural Networks; Spatiotemporal Sparse Data; Uncertainty Quantification","Prediction models; Calibration method; Deterministics; Graph neural networks; Sparse data; Spatio-temporal prediction; Spatiotemporal datasets; Spatiotemporal sparse data; Uncertainty; Uncertainty quantifications; Zero values","We extend our gratitude to the reviewers for their time and effort in reviewing and refining our manuscript.

In this article, we mainly focus on the research and application of the domain-specific knowledge graph in the field of the smart city, which has not been fully paid attention to. Currently, the major problem faced by the smart city lies in data mining and proper application. On the one hand, data are usually stored by government management departments, which creates challenges such as high data storing overhead and inefficient data usage. On the other hand, data cannot be coordinated and collaborated between different city management systems, because data silos exist. By constructing the corresponding knowledge graph, the data of urban traffic, services, and public resources are integrated to provide help for city builders and managers to make important decisions. Therefore, we will review the related literature on the knowledge graph existing in the smart city domain to expore reasearch scopes. Specifically, we will analyze and summarize knowledge graph construction research in the field of smart cities from four perspectives, i.e., smart city ontology, urban data processing, urban knowledge graph construction, and their application.

The introduction of cross-area knowledge transfer offers a valuable method for mitigating the impact of data scarcity in areas with limited samples and for conducting spatial prediction. With technological advancements, spatial prediction methods based on transfer learning and the Third Law of Geography have become mainstream in the fields of computer science and geography. Transfer learning techniques leverage knowledge from a source domain with abundant data to solve related tasks in a target domain with limited data. Meanwhile, the proposal and application of the Third Law of Geography show that by comparing the similarity of geographical environmental variables between sampled regions and unsampled regions (rather than relying solely on traditional spatial distance or quantitative relationships), it is possible to predict target information in unsampled regions using a small amount of sample data. This provides a theoretical basis and methodological reference for selecting the source domain and target domain in cross-regional knowledge transfer. This paper conducts a literature review of cross-regional spatial prediction research based on these two major methods since 2018, focusing on the following key tasks: (1) Comparing and analyzing the basic principles of spatial prediction based on geographical similarity and transfer learning, and identifying differences in their technical procedures; (2) Summarizing the differences in similarity representation indicators and measurement methods between the two approaches; (3) Examining differences in commonly used auxiliary data, spatial analysis units, modeling methods, and evaluation indicators between the two prediction methods; (4) Discussing the challenges and limitations faced by these cross-regional knowledge transfer methods. The study shows that while the technical principles of both methods are basically consistent, they have specific limitations regarding their scope of application, similarity representation and measurement, relevant auxiliary variables, and parameter selection. The research offers useful insights for optimizing and improving these methods, integrating them effectively, innovating cross-regional prediction approaches, and expanding their application fields. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cross-area; Geographic Similarity; knowledge transfer; spatial prediction; the Third Law of Geography; transfer learning","Adversarial machine learning; Data transfer; Jurassic; Transfer learning; Cross-area; Data scarcity; Geographic similarity; Geographics; Knowledge transfer; Prediction research; Prediction-based; Spatial prediction; The third law of geography; Prediction models; comparative study; knowledge; literature review; machine learning; prediction; spatial analysis; theoretical study","Funding text 1: National Key Research and Development Program, No. 2022YFB3903602; National Natural Science Foundation of China, No.42371251; Youth Fund of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, No.42001159; Open Laboratory Fund of Capital Normal University in 2024, No.LIP2024S252.; Funding text 2: \u6536\u7A3F\u65E5\u671F\uFF1A2024-06-23\uFF1B\u4FEE\u56DE\u65E5\u671F\uFF1A2024-09-07. \u57FA\u91D1\u9879\u76EE\uFF1A\u56FD\u5BB6\u91CD\u70B9\u7814\u53D1\u8BA1\u5212\u9879\u76EE \uFF08 2022YFB3903602\uFF09 \uFF1B\u56FD\u5BB6\u81EA\u7136\u79D1\u5B66\u57FA\u91D1\u9879\u76EE \uFF08 42371251\uFF09 \uFF1B\u56FD\u5BB6\u81EA\u7136\u79D1\u5B66\u57FA\u91D1\u9752\u5E74\u9879\u76EE \uFF0842001159\uFF09\uFF1B\u9996\u90FD\u5E08\u8303\u5927\u5B662024\u5E74\u5EA6\u5B9E\u9A8C\u5BA4\u5F00\u653E\u57FA\u91D1\u9879\u76EE\uFF08LIP2024S252\uFF09\u3002[Foundationitems:NationalKey Research and Development Program, No.2022YFB3903602; National Natural Science Foundation of China, No.42371251;Y outhFundoftheNationalNaturalScienceFoundationofChina,No.42001 159;OpenLaboratoryFund ofCapitalNormalUniversityin2024,No.LIP2024S252.] \u4F5C\u8005\u7B80\u4ECB\uFF1A\u683E\u96E8\u8283 \uFF08 2001\u2014\uFF09 \uFF0C\u5973\uFF0C\u5C71\u4E1C\u6D4E\u5357\u4EBA\uFF0C\u7855\u58EB\u751F\uFF0C\u4E3B\u8981\u7814\u7A76\u65B9\u5411\u4E3A\u72AF\u7F6A\u5730\u7406\u4E0E\u72AF\u7F6A\u5206\u6790\u3002E-mail:pp2001081 1@126.com *\u901A\u8BAF\u4F5C\u8005\uFF1A\u8D3A\u65E5\u5174\uFF08 1972\u2014\uFF09\uFF0C\u7537\uFF0C\u6C5F\u897F\u5B89\u798F\u4EBA\uFF0C\u535A\u58EB\uFF0C\u6559\u6388\uFF0C\u4E3B\u8981\u7814\u7A76\u65B9\u5411\u4E3A\u72AF\u7F6A\u5730\u7406\u548C\u65F6\u7A7A\u5927\u6570\u636E\u7B49\u3002 E-mail:herixing@cnu.edu.cn","","Science Press","15608999","","","","Chinese","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210277396"

This paper presents a data-driven method for assessing the susceptibility of urban regions to emergencies, using publicly available data and a clustering-based algorithm. The study incorporates both spatial and temporal dynamics, capturing the fluctuating nature of urban infrastructure and patterns of human movement over time. By introducing the notion of Points of Temporal Influence (PTIs) and a new “susceptibility level” parameter, the proposed model offers an innovative approach to understanding urban susceptibility. Experiments conducted in London, the UK, demonstrated the effectiveness of the Spatiotemporal K-means Clustering algorithm in identifying areas with heightened time-sensitive susceptibility. The findings highlight the value of incorporating both spatial and temporal data to enhance emergency response strategies and optimize urban planning efforts.

Real-world anomalous events are complicated due to diverse human behaviors and class variations. Anomalous activities depend upon speed, length of activity, and motion features to comprehend suspicious behaviors. Fast activities are captured quickly within a few video frames, whereas slow actions may take several hundred video frames to define an anomalous action. Furthermore, a video is more than just a stack of frames with spatiotemporal representations. Most of the existing approaches suffer from learning variable speed fast and slow activities simultaneously and primarily focus on learning spatiotemporal features only. Modeling the spatiotemporal and motion relationships between frames together can help understand the actions better. Motion features when combined with spatiotemporal representations perform higher. Our contribution is two-fold in this research work. Firstly, a novel dynamic frame-skipping approach is proposed to duly generate meaningful representations of spatiotemporal frames and optical-flow-based motion representations for variable speed anomalous actions. Secondly, AnomalyNet, as a new end-to-end deep architecture, is designed to simultaneously learn both spatiotemporal and motion features in image sequences. AnomalyNet is evaluated on the challenging real-world anomaly detection datasets. The results confirm that the proposed model has achieved a competitive AUC of 86.1% on the real-world UCF-Crime dataset and has achieved a superior AUC score of 99.87% compared to state-of-the-art methods on challenging ShanghaiTech dataset in the domain of unsupervised, weakly-supervised, and fully-supervised anomaly detection. Furthermore, the model achieved the highest F1 score for both fast and slow variable speed anomalous activities, such as explosions, road accidents, robbery, and stealing for real-world autonomous surveillance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AnomalyNet; Autonomous surveillance; Dynamic frame-skipping; Real-world anomalies detection; Spatiotemporal and motion-aware deep learning","Behavioral research; Crime; Deep learning; Highway accidents; Motion analysis; Anomaly detection; Anomalynet; Autonomous surveillance; Dynamic frame; Dynamic frame-skipping; Frame skipping; Motion features; Real-world; Real-world anomaly detection; Spatiotemporal and motion-aware deep learning","This research was supported by the PDE-GIR project, which received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Skodowska-Curie grant with the agreement number 778035.","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","01782789; 14322315","","VICOE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181227647"

Existing works advance the field by capturing complex traffic correlations from spatial and temporal perspectives using deep learning models, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, current works do not consider the unique perspective from the illegal parking data collection process carried out by patrol officers, which can reflect a wealth of knowledge gained from each officer's on-the-ground experiences for more effective patrol. In this paper, we propose a novel behavior-aware hypergraph convolutional network named BHIPP for city-wide illegal parking prediction. To better represent the correlations of illegal parking events from patrol officers' perspective, we construct a new patrol hypergraph integrating patrol officers' experience alongsie multi-source contextual information. Additionally, we design a behavior-aware hypergraph convolutional network, which captures the complex and high-order illegal parking event correlations with officers' patrol behaviors explicitly considered. Further, we introduce a spatial-temporal illegal parking approximation module to estimate parking violations in under-patrolled regions using both historical and multi-source contextual data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed BHIPP compared with a broad range of state-of-the-art baseline models across varying spatial-temporal granularities, from both regression and ranking aspects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","hypergraph convolutional networks; illegal parking prediction","Crime; Parking; Urban planning; Contextual information; Convolutional networks; Hyper graph; Hypergraph convolutional network; Illegal parking; Illegal parking prediction; Learning models; Multi-Sources; Patrol officer; Spatial temporals; Deep learning","We thank all the reviewers for their insightful feedback to improve this paper.

Therefore, to prevent traffic accidents, predicting their risks has garnered growing interest. We argue that a desired prediction solution should demonstrate resilience to the complexity of traffic accidents. In particular, it should adequately consider the regional background, accurately capture both spatial proximity and semantic similarity, and effectively address the sparsity of traffic accidents. However, these factors are often overlooked or difficult to incorporate. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-granularity hierarchical spatio-temporal network. Initially, we innovate by incorporating remote sensing data, facilitating the creation of hierarchical multi-granularity structure and the comprehension of regional background. We construct multiple high-level risk prediction tasks to enhance model's ability to cope with sparsity. Subsequently, to capture both spatial proximity and semantic similarity, region feature and multi-view graph undergo encoding processes to distill effective representations. Additionally, we propose message passing and adaptive temporal attention module that bridges different granularities and dynamically captures time correlations inherent in traffic accident patterns. At last, a multivariate hierarchical loss function is devised considering the complexity of the prediction purpose. Extensive experiments on two real datasets verify the superiority of our model against the state-of-the-art methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","remote sensing; spatio-temporal data; traffic accident prediction","Highway accidents; Prediction models; Risk perception; Accident prediction; Multi-granularity; Remote-sensing; Risk predictions; Semantic similarity; Spatial proximity; Spatial semantics; Spatio-temporal data; Traffic accident prediction; Urban traffic; Health risks","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 62032003 and Grant No. 61921003.

However, scalability and generalization challenges remain significant obstacles. Advanced models often rely on Graph Neural Networks to encode spatial and temporal correlations, but struggle with the increased complexity of large-scale datasets. The recursive GNN-based message passing schemes used in these models hinder their training and deployment in real-life urban sensing scenarios. Moreover, long-spanning large-scale spatio-temporal data introduce distribution shifts, necessitating improved generalization performance. To address these challenges, we propose a simple framework for spatio-temporal prediction - EasyST paradigm. It learns lightweight and robust Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by effectively distilling knowledge from complex spatio-temporal GNNs. We ensure robust knowledge distillation by integrating the spatio-temporal information bottleneck with teacher-bounded regression loss, filtering out task-irrelevant noise and avoiding erroneous guidance. We further enhance the generalization ability of the student model by incorporating spatial and temporal prompts to provide downstream task contexts. Evaluation on three spatio-temporal datasets for urban computing tasks demonstrates that EasyST surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

How to accurately predict future occurrences is a key point in preventing these events. However, existing supervised methods struggle to perform well on sparse UUEs while self-supervised MAE-based methods adopt a traditional random masking strategy which leads to limited performance on UUE forecasting. Fortunately, we have designed an innovative spatiotemporal masking strategy and its corresponding pre-training task called <u>M</u>asked <u>S</u>patio-<u>T</u>emporal <u>E</u>vent Series <u>M</u>odeling (MSTEM). Through Cluster-assisted region masking, MSTEM efficiently distributes masked regions evenly among different clusters, enhancing the model's ability to capture spatial correlation and heterogeneity while addressing sparse region distribution of UUEs. Frequency-enhanced patch masking helps the model to sufficiently extract the temporal features of UUEs by reconstructing multiple views.

Imputing the missing values is crucial for analyzing time series. When recovering a specific data point, most existing methods consider all the information relevant to that point regardless of the cause-and-effect relationship. During data collection, it is inevitable that some unknown confounders are included, e.g., background noise in time series and non-causal shortcut edges in the constructed sensor network. These confounders could open backdoor paths and establish non-causal correlations between the input and output. Over-exploiting these non-causal correlations could cause overfitting. In this paper, we first revisit spatiotemporal time series imputation from a causal perspective and show how to block the confounders via the frontdoor adjustment. Based on the results of frontdoor adjustment, we introduce a novel <u>C</u>ausality-<u>A</u>ware <u>Sp</u>atiot<u>e</u>mpo<u>r</u>al Graph Neural Network (Casper), which contains a novel Prompt Based Decoder (PBD) and a Spatiotemporal Causal Attention (SCA). PBD could reduce the impact of confounders and SCA could discover the sparse causal relationships among embeddings. Theoretical analysis reveals that SCA discovers causal relationships based on the values of gradients. We evaluate Casper on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that Casper could outperform the baselines and could effectively discover the causal relationships. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","causal attention; spatiotemporal graph neural network; spatiotemporal time series imputation","Spatio-temporal data; Causal attention; Causal relationships; Confounder; Graph neural networks; Missing values; Monitoring sensors; Spatio-temporal graphs; Spatiotemporal graph neural network; Spatiotemporal time series imputation; Times series","","","Association for Computing Machinery","21550751","9781450309493; 9781595939913; 9781450324168; 9781581131468; 9781450324250; 9781605588100; 9781450309547; 9781450324137; 9781605588070; 9781450324212","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210002618"

Existing methods predominantly concentrate on the external factors influencing fashion trends, often disregarding the intricate interplay among distinct fashion elements, namely the ‘spatial dependencies’ among them. It is also a significant challenge to excavate complicated temporal relationships in complex time series data. In this research, our primary focus is modeling the relationships among diverse fashion elements and the intricate temporal dependencies within time series data. First, we propose a Street Fashion Trend (SFT) dataset by leveraging images from the popular photo-sharing platform Flickr 1 Furthermore, we propose a model called GNNctd to solve the above problems. This model leverages a spatial dependency capture module (SDCM) based on a graph neural network to dynamically model the ‘spatial dependency relationships’ among distinct fashion elements. Meanwhile, the model introduces a temporal relationship extraction block (TREB), which comprises two pivotal modules: the interaction learning (IL) module designed to capture local temporal dependencies and a global time attention module (GTAM) that is used to capture global temporal dependencies. Many experiments substantiate that the proposed GNNctd model can achieve more accurate predictions of fashion trends in our constructed dataset and the other three fashion trend datasets. Simultaneously, the GNNctd model achieves a state-of-the-art performance on the Solar-Energy, Exchange Rate, and Wind datasets within the domain of time series prediction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fashion trend prediction; Graph neural network; Time series prediction","Forecasting; Graph neural networks; Time series; Dependency model; Fashion trend prediction; Network-based; Spatial dependencies; Temporal relationships; Time series prediction; Time-series data; Trend forecasting; Trend prediction; Solar energy","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant no. 62302349, no. 62202345, the Nature Science Foundation of Hubei Province under Grant no. 2023AFB356, and the Open Fund of Hubei Luojia Laboratory under Grant no. 230100027.","","Elsevier B.V.","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200785349"

Criminal activities and disasters can have a significant impact on the stability of a city, resulting in a loss of safety and property for its residents. Therefore, predicting the occurrence of urban events in advance is of utmost importance. However, current methods fail to consider the impact of road information on the distribution of cases and the fusion of information at different scales. In order to solve the above problems, an urban spatiotemporal event prediction method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and road feature fusion network (FFN) named CNN-rFFN is proposed in this paper. The method is divided into two stages: The first stage constructs feature map and structure of CNN then selects the optimal feature map and number of CNN layers. The second stage extracts urban road network information using multiscale convolution and incorporates the extracted road network feature information into the CNN. Some comparison experiments are conducted on the 2018–2019 urban patrol events dataset in Zhengzhou City, China. The CNN-rFFN method has an R2 value of 0.9430, which is higher than the CNN, CNN-LSTM, Dilated-CNN, ResNet, and ST-ResNet algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the CNN-rFFN method has better performance than other methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","convolutional neural network; road feature fusion network; smart cities; urban spatiotemporal event","","This research is Funded by the High-level Talent Introduction Program of Henan University of Technology, grant number: 31401669.","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","22209964","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207684242"

Many normal events and abnormal events in videos are caused by the interactions between event objects and scenes or other objects, and thus they are usually object-centric and highly contextual. Currently, it is still an open problem to discriminate abnormal events by acquiring high-level semantic context information from low-level visual features in videos. To this end, we propose a novel context modeling and reasoning method for video abnormal event detection. The method mines event-related semantic context information from video data by generating video context graphs, which is able to narrow the semantic gap between the low-level visual features in videos and the high-level semantics of abnormal events, and then uses the semantic context information to discriminate abnormal events correctly in videos. Specifically, we first use a pre-trained object detection neural network to extract the initial appearance features of all objects, the spatiotemporal relationship features between different objects, as well as the scene features. Then we devise a context graph inference module to explicitly model three types of semantic contexts, including individual object behaviors, pairwise relationships among different objects, and interactions between objects and scenes, where the nodes of the graph could describe the object and scene features, and the edges of the graph describe the spatio-temporal relationship features. We finally build an anomaly prediction module to discriminate abnormal events according to the semantic contexts captured from the previous context graph in videos. The proposed context graph inference module is based on the mean-field theory, and includes multiple recurrent neural networks with message-passing modules. The message- passing modules iteratively update the state of nodes and edges in the context graph for inferring the high-level semantic contexts from the low-level feature representations. The proposed anomaly prediction module consists of two attention-pooling network layers and one fully-connected network layer. The obtained context information is finally fed into the anomaly prediction module to calculate anomaly scores of all video frames for video abnormal event detection. In experiments, we introduce a strategy to train the network mod-is in four manners, including unsupervised, semi-supervised, weakly supervised and supervised manners. In this way, the spatiotemporal context graph inference module and anomaly prediction module are trained in an end-to-end manner seamlessly, such that they reinforce each other. The context reasoning method is evaluated on four public challenging datasets, including three semi-supervised datasets, i. e., the Subway (Entrance/Exit) dataset, Avenue dataset and Shanghai Tech dataset, as well as a supervised UCF-Crime dataset, respectively. Compared with existing methods without context modeling and reasoning, our context modeling and reasoning method improves the unsupervised AUC values by 2.7%/3.1%, 2.0% and 2.9% on the Subway (Entrance/Exit) dataset, Avenue dataset and Shanghai Tech dataset, and improves the semi-supervised AUC values by 3.5 %/3.3%, 4.0% and 4.3%, respectively. Compared with existing methods without considering context modeling and reasoning on the supervised UCF-Crime dataset, our method significantly improves the semi-supervised, weakly-supervised and supervised AUC values by 2. 1%, 0. 4% and 9. 2%, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","abnormal event detection; context graph; context mod-ling and reasoning; deep learning; self-training strategy","Graph neural networks; Health risks; Image coding; Inference engines; Multilayer neural networks; Network theory (graphs); Semi-supervised learning; Abnormal event detections; Context graph; Context information; Context mod-ling and reasoning; Context modeling and reasoning; Deep learning; Self-training; Self-training strategy; Semantic context; Training strategy; Recurrent neural networks","","","Science Press","02544164","","JIXUD","","Chinese","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206161338"

The efficiency and effectiveness of solving these tasks directly depends of the efficiency and effectiveness of data fusion (DF). Data fusion methods are designed to integrate data from multiple sources and transform it in order to produce more consistent, accurate, and useful information than that provided by any individual data source. Although DF has been extensively studied for a considerable period of time it is still hardly applicable in practice in the processes of the control of the real world objects with complex structure and behavior as the data produced by the objects is, in the majority of cases, heterogeneous, multimodal, and imperfect, has huge volume. To ensure proper response to the changes in the state and behavior of the controlled objects that can be caused by both internal and external influencing factors the data should be processed with high accuracy and with minimum delays. Despite the importance of the tasks of complex objects control till now there are no researches that clarify to what extent the DF problem has been solved from the perspective of its application in the processes of objects control based on the data received from the objects. In the survey we define the requirements to DF in the interests of the control of complex artificial and natural objects, consider the structure of the multilevel process of intelligent object control, identify the neural networks that can be used in the control process for data fusion. Despite the wide capabilities of the existing NN we reveal that they still do not meet all the requirements to DF for complex objects control. Based on the analysis of NN architectures, we define requirements for advanced NN architectures and discuss future research directions. To facilitate our literature analyses, we also perform conceptual exploration of collected papers with lattices of closed itemsets and implications from Formal Concept Analysis and Data Mining used for knowledge processing in similar large-scale studies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data fusion; Intelligent control; Neural networks; Requirements","Complex networks; Data mining; Efficiency; Formal concept analysis; Network architecture; Process control; Artificial objects; Complex objects; Data fusion methods; Multilevel control; Multiple source; Natural objects; Neural-networks; Object based; Objects-based; Requirement; Data fusion","Funding text 1: This research is funded by National Key Research and Development Program No. 2023YFF0905400, and National Natural Science Foundation No. U2341229.

Untreated depression can escalate the risk of suicide, making the situation even worse. Despite an abundance of models previously proposed for forecasting depression, the issue of foretelling the overall number of patients at each administrative level remains under-investigated. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a simple but effective SpatioTemporal Monitoring Framework for National Depression Forecasting (MONDEP). In particular, we analyze national depression statistics data in Thailand as a case study and create prediction models for a real-time depression forecasting system using machine learning and deep learning approaches. In order to forecast the prevalence of depression at various administrative levels, we use the hierarchical structure of depression aggregation. The proposed framework consists of three modules: Data Pre-processing to extract and pre-process the raw data, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize and analyze the data to get insight, and Model Training and Testing to predict future depression cases. The objective of our research is to construct a comprehensive MONDEP framework that utilizes machine learning and deep learning to predict depression profiles at the district and national levels using multivariate time series across various administrative levels. Our study illustrates the considerable association between a spatial-temporal component and demonstrates how depression profiles may be represented by employing lower administrative-level data to estimate the general level of mental health across the nation. Additionally, the best performance across all criteria is obtained when a deep learning model is used to exploit multivariate time series, showing a 13% improvement in MAE measure compared to the SARIMAX baseline. We believe the proposed framework could be used as a point of reference for decision-making regarding the management of depression and has the potential to be incredibly helpful for policymakers in successfully managing mental health services on time. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep learning; Depression forecasting; Machine learning; Time series forecasting","","This research paper is supported by Specific League Funds from Mahidol University.

Traditional models, which are grounded in physical and numerical frameworks, provide robust explanations by explicitly reconstructing underlying physical processes. However, their limitations in comprehensively capturing Earth's complexities and uncertainties pose challenges in optimization and real-world applicability. In contrast, contemporary data-driven models, particularly those utilizing machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), leverage extensive geoscience data to glean insights without requiring exhaustive theoretical knowledge. ML techniques have shown promise in addressing Earth science-related questions. Nevertheless, challenges such as data scarcity, computational demands, data privacy concerns, and the “black-box” nature of AI models hinder their seamless integration into geoscience. The integration of physics-based and data-driven methodologies into hybrid models presents an alternative paradigm. These models, which incorporate domain knowledge to guide AI methodologies, demonstrate enhanced efficiency and performance with reduced training data requirements. This review provides a comprehensive overview of geoscientific research paradigms, emphasizing untapped opportunities at the intersection of advanced AI techniques and geoscience. It examines major methodologies, showcases advances in large-scale models, and discusses the challenges and prospects that will shape the future landscape of AI in geoscience. The paper outlines a dynamic field ripe with possibilities, poised to unlock new understandings of Earth's complexities and further advance geoscience exploration. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; deep learning; geoscience; machine learning","Adversarial machine learning; Data collection; Data-driven approach; Deep learning; Geosciences; Machine-learning; Optimisations; Physical process; Physics-based models; Traditional models; Uncertainty; Contrastive Learning","This work was partially supported by NSFC (nos.

However, in social network analysis (SNA), designing fairness-aware methods for various research problems by considering structural bias and inequalities of large-scale social networks has not received much attention. In this work, we highlight how the structural bias of social networks impacts the fairness of different SNA methods. We further discuss fairness aspects that should be considered while proposing network structure-based solutions for different SNA problems, such as link prediction, influence maximization, centrality ranking, and community detection. This survey-cum-vision clearly highlights that very few works have considered fairness and bias while proposing solutions; even these works are mainly focused on some research topics, such as link prediction, influence maximization, and PageRank. However, fairness has not yet been addressed for other research topics, such as influence blocking and community detection. We review the state of the art for different research topics in SNA, including the considered fairness constraints, their limitations, and our vision. This survey also covers evaluation metrics, available datasets and synthetic network generating models used in such studies. Finally, we highlight various open research directions that require researchers' attention to bridge the gap between fairness and SNA. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","algorithmic fairness; fairness-aware methods; Network science; social network analysis","Learning algorithms; Population dynamics; Social networking (online); Algorithmic fairness; Algorithmics; AS-links; Fairness-aware method; Influence maximizations; Link prediction; Network science; Research topics; Social Network Analysis; Structural bias; Natural language processing systems","This work was partially supported by JST ASPIRE, Grant Number JPMJAP2328.","","Association for Computing Machinery","03600300; 15577341","","ACSUE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193538387"

The abundance of online data sources such as social networks, official news articles, and personal blogs chronicle societal events, facilitating the development of AI models for social science, public health care, and decision making. Human event modeling generally comprises both the forecasting stage, which estimates future events based on historical data, and interpretation, which seeks to identify influential factors of such events to understand their causative attributes. Recent achievements, fueled by deep learning and the availability of public data, have significantly advanced the field of human event modeling. This survey offers a systematic overview of deep learning technologies for forecasting and interpreting human events, with a primary focus on political events. We first introduce the existing challenges and background in this domain. We then present the problem formulation of event forecasting and interpretation. We investigate recent achievements in graph neural networks, owing to the prevalence of relational data and the efficacy of graph learning models.

Premature predictions may yield a higher rate of false alarms, whereas delaying predictions to gather more information can render them too late to be useful. In applications such as wildfires, crimes, and traffic jams, timely forecasting are vital for safeguarding human life and property. Consequently, finding a balance between accuracy and timeliness is crucial. In this paper, we propose an early spatio-temporal forecasting model based on Multi-Objective reinforcement learning that can either implement an optimal policy given a preference or infer the preference based on a small number of samples. The model addresses two primary challenges: 1) enhancing the accuracy of early forecasting and 2) providing the optimal policy for determining the most suitable prediction time for each area. Our method demonstrates superior performance on three large-scale real-world datasets, surpassing existing methods in early spatio-temporal forecasting tasks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","early detection; graph neural network; responsible AI; spatio-temporal data","Graph neural networks; Traffic congestion; Early detection; High rate; Multi objective; Optimal policies; Prediction tasks; Reinforcement learnings; Responsible AI; Spatio-temporal data; Spatio-temporal forecasting; Prediction models","We acknowledge the support of the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society (ADM+S) (CE200100005).

Investigation of deep learning for HOIs, thus, has become a valuable agenda for the data mining and machine learning communities. As networks of HOIs are expressed mathematically as hypergraphs, hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for representation learning on hypergraphs. Given the emerging trend, we present the first survey dedicated to HNNs, with an in-depth and step-by-step guide. Broadly, the present survey overviews HNN architectures, training strategies, and applications. First, we break existing HNNs down into four design components: (i) input features, (ii) input structures, (iii) message-passing schemes, and (iv) training strategies. Second, we examine how HNNs address and learn HOIs with each of their components. Third, we overview the recent applications of HNNs in recommendation, bioinformatics and medical science, time series analysis, and computer vision. Lastly, we conclude with a discussion on limitations and future directions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","data mining; deep learning; hypergraph; hypergraph neural network; survey","Adversarial machine learning; Deep neural networks; Holmium alloys; Deep learning; High-order; Higher-order; Hyper graph; Hypergraph neural network; Machine learning communities; Neural-networks; Real-world; Training strategy; Message passing","This work was partly supported by Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2022-0-00157, Robust, Fair, Extensible Data-Centric Continual Learning) (No. RS-2019-II190075, Artificial Intelligence Graduate School Program (KAIST)).

Despite considerable efforts have been made for FGL under either cross-device or cross-silo paradigm, how to effectively capture graph knowledge in a more complicated cross-silo cross-device environment remains an under-explored problem. However, this task is challenging because of the inherent hierarchy and heterogeneity of decentralized clients, diversified privacy constraints in different clients, and the cross-client graph integrity requirement. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Federated Graph Learning (HiFGL) framework for cross-silo cross-device FGL. Specifically, we devise a unified hierarchical architecture to safeguard federated GNN training on heterogeneous clients while ensuring graph integrity. Moreover, we propose a Secret Message Passing (SecMP) scheme to shield unauthorized access to subgraph-level and node-level sensitive information simultaneously. Theoretical analysis proves that HiFGL achieves multi-level privacy preservation with complexity guarantees. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the superiority of the proposed framework against several baselines. Furthermore, HiFGL's versatile nature allows for its application in either solely cross-silo or cross-device settings, further broadening its utility in real-world FGL applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","federated graph learning; graph neural network; multi-level privacy preservation","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Differential privacy; Knowledge graph; Decentralised; Federated graph learning; Graph data; Graph neural networks; High quality; Learn+; Multi-level privacy preservation; Multilevels; Privacy constraints; Privacy preservation; Federated learning","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.62102110, No.92370204), National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No.2023YFF0725004), Guangzhou- HKUST(GZ) Joint Funding Program (Grant No. 2022A03J00056, No.2023A03J0008), Education Bureau of Guangzhou Municipality.","","Association for Computing Machinery","2154817X","9798400714542; 9798400712456; 9781450308373; 9781450315500; 1595936092; 9781450315609; 9781450315548; 9781450315562; 9781450315425; 9781450308137","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203667048"

This paper introduces an innovative multi-stage method to forecast unbuilt projects using operational data from hospital information systems and building design models to automatically calculate spatial demands. The study’s main findings demonstrate that our method successfully outputs regional demand data, supporting hospital design validation and operational decision-making. Through processing and analyzing log data, this research identified the dynamic characteristics of user activities in hospital buildings and converted them into a time series data format. This method has iterative self-validation and self-optimization features and can maintain flexibility in different scenarios and frequently changing design drawings. This method will provide technical support for a wide range of hospital building stakeholders and has the potential to be applied to more types of buildings.

Multi-domain news refers to handling diverse content across various subject areas such as politics, health, research, crime, and social concerns. Recognizing the lack of systematic research in multi-domain fake news detection, we present a fundamental structure by combining datasets from several news domains. Our two-tiered detection approach, BERTGuard, starts with domain classification, which uses a BERT-based model trained on a combined multi-domain dataset to determine the domain of a given news piece. Following that, domain-specific BERT models evaluate the correctness of news inside each designated domain, assuring precision and reliability tailored to each domain’s unique characteristics. Rigorous testing on previously encountered datasets from critical life areas such as politics, health, research, crime, and society proves the system’s performance and generalizability. For addressing the class imbalance challenges inherent when combining datasets, our study rigorously evaluates the impact on detection accuracy and explores handling alternatives—random oversampling, random upsampling, and class weight adjustment. These criteria provide baselines for comparison, fortifying the detection system against the complexities of imbalanced datasets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","class imbalance; deep learning; domain classification; fake news","Class imbalance; Deep learning; Domain classification; Fake news; Health concerns; Health research; Multi-domains; Social concerns; Social well-being; Systematic research","","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","25042289","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202344359"

In recent years, smart city systems devoted to detecting, alerting, and mitigating emergency situations have gained momentum, with different complexities and expected outcomes. Although such systems have become more common, their proper configuration and adoption should rely on a more comprehensive perception of urban vulnerabilities to critical events. This article defines a data-driven approach to numerically evaluate the vulnerability of each region of a city, taking real-world data from open databases as a reference for a proposed clustering-based assessment algorithm. Additionally, the temporal dynamics within a city are modelled through the definition of time frames, each one comprising an associated risk assessment factor based on the expected flow of inhabitants over time. This clustering analysis categorises urban areas with similar vulnerability profiles by modelling the temporal dynamics of urban infrastructure, capturing their fluctuating nature and impact on vulnerability. By leveraging temporal urban perceptions, this approach may contribute to more effective emergency management in urban areas since regions with higher population density may be assumed as more vulnerable to emergencies, potentially supporting the optimisation of smart cities and general urban planning. Experimental results for the Portuguese cities of Porto and Lisbon demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed approach by accurately identifying regions with higher temporal vulnerability to urban emergencies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data-driven urban planning; K-means; OpenStreetMap; Sustainability; Urban resilience","K-means clustering; Open Data; Population statistics; Risk assessment; Risk management; Smart city; Climatic changes; Clustering approach; Data driven; Data-driven urban planning; Emergency situation; K-means; Openstreetmap; Temporal dynamics; Urban areas; Urban resilience; Urban planning; algorithm; climate change; climate effect; perception; risk assessment; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; urban area; urban planning; vulnerability; Lisboa [Portugal]; Lisbon; Porto [Porto (DST)]; Porto [Portugal]; Portugal","Funding text 1: This work is financially supported by national funds through the FCT/MCTES (PIDDAC), Portugal, under the project EXPL/EEI-COM/1089/2021.; Funding text 2: This work is financially supported by national funds through the FCT/MCTES (PIDDAC) , under the project EXPL/EEI-COM/1089/2021 .","","Elsevier Ltd","22106707","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192450230"

The human mobility is closely related to travel mode. Scientifically predicting human mobility can help alleviate traffic congestion and provide flexible travel choices. However, in current predictions, only the travel demand or human mobility is taken into account, while the influence of residents on the travel mode choice is neglected. Therefore, taking Wuhan City as an example, this paper proposes a new method for predicting human mobility by employing graph neural network techniques and travel mode choice behavior. The prediction model established in this study utilizes network analysis to measure the accessibility time and road network distance of traffic travel mode. The graph neural network method is employed to capture the dynamic temporal and spatial relationships underlying human mobility. Furthermore, the performance of the prediction model is evaluated. The results indicate that at a fine spatial scale, the new method can more accurately reveal the spatial patterns of changes in human mobility, significantly improving the accuracy of predicting human mobility. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Graph neural networks; Human mobility; Mobile phone data; Travel mode","Forecasting; Graph neural networks; Motor transportation; 'current; Human mobility; Human mobility predictions; Mobile phone datum; Prediction modelling; Travel demand; Travel mode choices; Travel modes; Wuhan cities; Traffic congestion","","","Elsevier B.V.","03784371","","PHYAD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196011536"

However, there is no publicly available dataset so far and most existing approaches are limited to an extremely small scope of brands, which seriously hinders the research on site recommendation. Therefore, we collect, construct and release an open comprehensive dataset, namely OpenSiteRec, to facilitate and promote the research on site recommendation. Specifically, OpenSiteRec leverages a heterogeneous graph schema to represent various types of real-world entities and relations in four international metropolises. To evaluate the performance of the existing general methods on the site recommendation task, we conduct benchmarking experiments of several representative recommendation models on OpenSiteRec. Furthermore, we also highlight the potential application directions to demonstrate the wide applicability of OpenSiteRec.

Though spatio-temporal graph convolution has shown promising results for subway passenger flow prediction, the existing spatial modeling methods based on graph convolution will bring huge spatial memory consumption for complex bus lines and larger-scale node data. Additionally, bus passenger flow is significantly influenced by immediate traffic conditions within a short time. To tackle these challenges, a multi-scale fusion and dynamic adaptive graph bus passenger flow prediction model (MFDAG) is presented. The proposed model effectively integrates passenger flow, time, and weekly information to enhance the feature dimension of the data. Moreover, it employs a dynamic adaptive graph method to learn the relationships between different stations. Furthermore, a multi-scale fusion propagation method is proposed to represent the complex spatial dependency relation, and a multi-scale convolution propagation method is designed to learn the multi-scale temporal dependency relation. The experiments are conducted by using two passenger flow datasets, and the results are compared with other traffic prediction methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed bus passenger flow prediction method based on multi-scale fusion and dynamic adaptive graph exhibits higher prediction accuracy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","bus passenger flow prediction; dynamic adaptive graph; graph sampling; multi-scale fusion","","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (62202395, 62176221), the Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province (2022NSFSC0930), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (2682022CX067), and the Science and Technology Plan of Sichuan Province (MZGC20230073).","","Journal of Computer Engineering and Applications Beijing Co., Ltd.; Science Press","16739418","","","","Chinese","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198638354"

A recent trend is to develop forecasting models based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNN-based methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) current models broaden receptive fields by scaling the depth of GNNs, which is insufficient to preserve the semantics of long-range connectivity between distant but epidemic related areas. (2) Previous approaches model epidemics within single spatial scale, while ignoring the multi-scale epidemic patterns derived from different scales. To address these deficiencies, we devise the Multi-scale Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Network (MSGNN) based on an innovative multi-scale view. To be specific, in the proposed MSGNN model, we first devise a novel graph learning module, which directly captures long-range connectivity from trans-regional epidemic signals and integrates them into a multi-scale graph. Based on the learned multi-scale graph, we utilize a newly designed graph convolution module to exploit multi-scale epidemic patterns. This module allows us to facilitate multi-scale epidemic modeling by mining both scale-shared and scale-specific patterns. Experimental results on forecasting new cases of COVID-19 in United State demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-arts. Further analyses and visualization also show that MSGNN offers not only accurate, but also robust and interpretable forecasting result.

However, existing methods face challenges in capturing complex spatiotemporal anomalies effectively. To address this, we propose an anomaly graph approach that leverages dynamic graph representations and dynamic graph convolutional networks (GCN) for video anomaly detection. Anomaly graph constructs dynamic graphs where nodes represent objects or regions of interest within video frames while the edges encode spatial and temporal relationships. The GCN architecture extracts spatiotemporal embeddings from the dynamic graphs and allows the model to identify anomalies involving both spatial and temporal cues. Anomaly graph introduces uniqueness scores to quantify frame distinctiveness for precise anomaly detection while it employs adaptive reconstruction errors to pinpoint spatially localized anomalies. Real-time alerts are generated for detected anomalies to ensure timely responses to security incidents, and online fine-tuning (OLT) is incorporated as a dynamic learning mechanism to adapt to evolving anomaly patterns existing in dynamic environments. The extensive experimentation on benchmark datasets including UCSD Ped2 and CUHK Avenue is carried out for diverse performance measures, and the anomaly graph exhibits enhanced performance in the detection of anomalous events by achieving a detection accuracy of 98.72% and precision of 97.18%. Moreover, it is found to have achieved better values compared to other related methods for video anomaly detection. Overall, the anomaly graph introduces a robust video anomaly detection framework that excels in identifying complex spatiotemporal anomalies and empowers surveillance and security systems to detect anomalies more effectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive reconstruction errors; Alert generation; Anomaly detection; Dynamic graph; Graph convolutional network; Uniqueness scores; Video surveillance system","Benchmarking; Complex networks; Convolution; Image reconstruction; Network security; Security systems; Adaptive reconstruction; Adaptive reconstruction error; Alert generation; Anomaly detection; Convolutional networks; Dynamic graph; Graph convolutional network; Reconstruction error; Uniqueness score; Video surveillance systems","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","14333058; 09410643","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190706217"

The ability to accurately predict traffic accident not only supports the governmental decision-making in advance but also enhances public confidence in safety measures. However, the efficacy of traditional spatio-temporal prediction models are compromised by the skewed distributions and sparse labeling of accident data. To this end, we propose a Sparse Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Hypergraph Learning (SST-DHL) framework that captures higher-order dependencies in sparse traffic accidents by combining hypergraph learning and self-supervised learning. The SST-DHL model incorporates a multi-view spatiotemporal convolution block to capture local correlations and semantics of traffic accidents, a cross-regional dynamic hypergraph learning model to identify global spatiotemporal dependencies, and a two-supervised self-learning paradigm to capture both local and global spatiotemporal patterns. Through experimentation on New York City and London accident datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed SST-DHL exhibits significant improvements compared to optimal baseline models at different sparsity levels. Additionally, it offers enhanced interpretability of results by elucidating complex spatio-temporal dependencies among various traffic accident instances. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of the SST-DHL framework in accurately predicting traffic accidents, thereby enhancing public safety and trust. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hypergraph Learning; Self-Supervised Learning; Sparse Data; Spatio-Temporal Prediction; Traffic Accident Prediction","Decision making; Highway accidents; Semantics; Accident prediction; Hyper graph; Hypergraph learning; Learning frameworks; Learning models; Self-supervised learning; Sparse data; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Spatio-temporal prediction; Traffic accident prediction; Forecasting; England; human; methodology; New York; prevention and control; traffic accident; Accidents, Traffic; Humans; London; New York City; Research Design","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2023YFC3009600 ), the Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62333016 ) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Civil Aviation Administration of China under Grant (No. U2333206 ).

Recent studies have revealed promising results using supervised learning methods in classifying illicit Bitcoin transactions of Elliptic data, one of the largest labelled data of Bitcoin transaction graphs. Nonetheless, all learning algorithms have failed to capture the dark market shutdown event that occurred in this data using its original features. This paper proposes a novel method named recurrent graph neural network model that extracts the temporal and graph topology of Bitcoin data to perform node classification as licit/illicit transactions. The proposed model performs sequential predictions that rely on recent labelled transactions designated by antecedent neighbouring features. Our main finding is that the proposed model against various models on Elliptic data has achieved state-of-the-art with accuracy and f<inf>1</inf>-score of 98.99% and 91.75%, respectively. Moreover, we visualise a snapshot of a Bitcoin transaction graph of Elliptic data to perform a case study using a backward reasoning process. The latter highlights the effectiveness of the proposed model from the explainability perspective. Sequential prediction leverages the dynamicity of the graph network in Elliptic data. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anti-money laundering; Bitcoin blockchain; Graph neural network; Long short-term memory","Bitcoin; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Distributed ledger; Feedforward neural networks; Forecasting; Graph neural networks; Learning algorithms; Anti-money laundering; Bitcoin blockchain; Block-chain; Convolutional networks; Labeled data; Machine learning algorithms; Novel methods; Sequential prediction; Supervised learning methods; Blockchain","","","Springer","13807501; 15737721","","MTAPF","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180223978"

However, this task is challenging mainly because the risk of the concerned potential victim is not isolated. Terrorism risk has a spatiotemporal interprovincial contagious characteristic. The risk diffusion mechanism comes from three possibilities: cross-provincial terrorist attacks, internal and external echoes, and internal self-excitation. This study proposed a novel spatiotemporal graph convolutional network (STGCN)-based extension method to capture the complex and multidimensional non-Euclidean relationships between different provinces and forecast the daily risks. Specifically, three graph structures were constructed to represent the contagious process between provinces: the distance graph, the province-level root cause similarity graph, and the self-excited graph. The long short-term memory and self-attention layers were extended to STGCN for capturing context-dependent temporal characters. At the same time, the one-dimensional convolutional neural network kernel with the gated linear unit inside the classical STGCN can model single-node-dependent temporal features, and the spectral graph convolution modules can capture spatial features. The experimental results on Afghanistan terrorist attack data from 2005 to 2020 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed extended STGCN method compared to other machine learning prediction models. Furthermore, the results illustrate the crucial of capturing comprehensive spatiotemporal correlation characters among provinces. Based on this, this article provides counter-terrorism management insights on addressing the long-term root causes of terrorism risk and performing short-term situational prevention. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","deep learning; graph convolutional networks; multi-graph representation; terrorism risk prediction","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Forecasting; Graph neural networks; Risk assessment; Terrorism; Convolutional networks; Graph convolutional network; Graph representation; Multi-graph representation; Network-based; Risk predictions; Spatio-temporal graphs; Terrorism risk prediction; Terrorism risks; Convolution; graphical method; machine learning; prediction; spatiotemporal analysis; terrorism; Afghanistan; article; attention; comparative effectiveness; convolutional neural network; deep learning; diffusion; excitation; short term memory","This research was supported and funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 71974067 and 71821001), and the Sichuan Science and Technology Program (grant number 2023NSFSC1015).","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","15396924; 02724332","","RIAND","37871999","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174590586"

However, along with the success of GNNs, the black box nature of AI models has led to various concerns (e.g. algorithmic bias and model misuse) regarding their adoption in urban analytics, particularly when studying socio-economics where high transparency is a crucial component of social justice. Therefore, the desire for increased model explainability and interpretability has attracted increasing research interest. This article proposes an explainable spatially explicit GeoAI-based analytical method that combines a graph convolutional network (GCN) and a graph-based explainable AI (XAI) method, called GNNExplainer. Here, we showcase the ability of our proposed method in two studies within urban analytics: traffic volume prediction and population estimation in the tasks of a node classification and a graph classification, respectively. For these tasks, we used Street View Imagery (SVI), a trending data source in urban analytics. We extracted semantic information from the images and assigned them as features of urban roads. The GCN first provided reasonable predictions related to these tasks by encoding roads as nodes and their connectivities and networks as graphs. The GNNExplainer then offered insights into how certain predictions are made. Through such a process, practical insights and conclusions can be derived from the urban phenomena studied here. In this paper we also set out a path for developing XAI in future urban studies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","explainable AI; geospatial artificial intelligence; graph neural networks; road networks; Urban analytics","artificial intelligence; road traffic; social justice; spatial analysis; urban area","Funding text 1: We appreciate the comments by the editor and the reviewers.

A fundamental and critical issue in modeling and forecasting urban problems lies in identifying suitable spatial analysis units, also known as city region partition. Existing works rely on subjective domain knowledge for static partitions, which is general and universal for all tasks. In fact, different tasks may need different city region partitions. To address this issue, we propose JLPR, a task-oriented framework for Joint Learning of region Partition and Representation. To make partitions fit tasks, JLPR integrates the region partition into the representation model training and learns region partitions using the supervision signal from the downstream task. We evaluate the framework on two prediction tasks (i.e., crime prediction and housing price prediction) in Chicago. Experiments show that JLPR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art partitioning methods in both tasks, which achieves above 25% and 70% performance improvements in terms of mean absolute error for crime prediction and house price prediction tasks, respectively.

Detecting and preventing human-related crimes within the footage captured by these systems is a challenging task. Traditionally, VS systems rely on basic motion detection, which often leads to false alarms and inefficient use of resources. Loitering, a behavior frequently associated with criminal activities, requires more nuanced detection to reduce false positives and improve response times. Accurate tracking of individuals, especially in crowded environments, is another challenge. The chief objective of this research is to address these challenges by introducing an innovative Loiteringbased Human Crime Detection (LHCD) module in VS. This module combines enhanced euclidean based Deep Simple Online Real-time Tracking (DSORT) with the Segmentation Quality Assessment (SQA) algorithm to accurately assess human travel distances.

Urban problems are strongly correlated with land use types and are spatially uncertain. Existing research on urban problems and land use types is limited, predominantly relying on land planning data and focusing on specific problems. Therefore, using Sanya as an example, this study identified the latest land use types by graph convolutional network (GCN) model and major urban problems from 480170 ""12345"" hotlines, further explored spatial heterogeneity and influencing factors of multi-category urban problems at the street scale under land use types. The results showed social security, noise, and household registration were the three most severe problems. Urban problems' spatial distribution differed significantly among land use types. Illegal parking and household registration were predominantly concentrated in residential and commercial lands, with noise pollution in green lands, land requisition demolition and wage arrears in agricultural lands, and social security and education problems in public service lands. Land use types and points of interest (POIs) significantly impacted urban problems. Residential and commercial lands were the primary epicenter, influencing various urban problems. Green lands greatly impacted noise pollution. Healthcare POIs positively impacted illegal parking, while financial institution POIs negatively influenced social governance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Influencing factors; Land use types; Spatial heterogeneity; The 12345-hotlines; Urban problems","Crime; Housing; Land use; Noise pollution; Green land; Illegal parking; Influencing factor; Land use type; Problem-based; Social Security; Spatial heterogeneity; The 12345-hotline; Urban problems; Well being; Spatial distribution; commercial activity; financial system; governance approach; land use; planning process; residential location; social security; spatial distribution; urban area; urban planning","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 72374062 , 71972064 and 72374060 ).","","Elsevier Ltd","22106707","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186757093"

Existing works generally regard regions with the similar number or distribution of PoI as similar. However, in practice, the region similarity depends on the surrounding environment as well, owing to the inherent imbalance observed in urban PoI data. In addition, the existing literature does not consider different task contexts when applying regional similarity. This paper primarily investigates how to appropriately represent the distribution of PoIs to measure the similarity between regions for diverse spatial and application contexts. A Context-Aware REgion similarity learning framework (CARE) is proposed, which utilizes a novel spatial normalization technique to capture the unique role of each region within its neighborhoods in order to address the inherent imbalance issue in urban data and a self-supervised contrastive learning method with triplet loss to tackle problem of missing labeled data in datasets. Considering the variations in how different applications define region similarity, CARE prompts large language model to adjust learned region embeddings and adapt them for specific application requirements. We conduct experiments on three datasets and two downstream tasks. Results show that compared with the baseline models, our model improves the performance of site selection recommendation and crime prediction by up to 19.60% and 35.86%, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Point-of-Interest; Spatial imbalance; Spatial normalization; Urban region similarity learning","Learning systems; Location based services; Telecommunication services; Context-Aware; Data driven; Learning context; Point-of-interest; Region similarity; Similarity learning; Spatial imbalance; Spatial normalization; Urban region similarity learning; Urban regions; Site selection","We would like to thank Jun Tang and Haoxiang Zhang for their early contributions to the code in the initial stages of this research paper.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of deep learning models designed to operate on graph data structures that consist of nodes and edges connecting them. GNNs have emerged as a powerful tool for detecting fraudulent activities in complex financial systems because they can analyze the network structure of financial transactions, capturing patterns and anomalies that traditional rule-based and machine learning methods might miss. The objective of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art technologies in using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for financial fraud detection, identify the gaps and limitations in the existing research, and suggest potential directions for future research. We searched five academic databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM, and science direct using specific keywords and search strings related to graph neural networks, financial areas, and anomaly detection to identify relevant publications, resulting in a total of 388 unique articles. We selected the relevant publications based on the inclusion, exclusion, and quality assessment criteria, and 33 articles were included in the review. In addition, forward snowballing was used to identify relevant papers that were not captured in the initial search. Data was extracted from the selected articles, then analyzed and summarized to identify current state, gaps, and trends in the literature. Our review presents a new taxonomy of GNNs applied in financial fraud detection and identifies potential research directions in this field. We find that GNNs applied to financial fraud detection have mostly been employed in a supervised or semi-supervised manner, with limited exploration of unsupervised approaches. In addition to financial areas, we explore the different types of graphs such as homogeneous, heterogenous, static, temporal, and dynamic graphs, and investigate the various learning mechanisms and anomaly types studied. We also note a lack of research on edge-level and graph-level anomaly detection commonly employed in financial domain. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anomaly detection; Financial fraud detection; GNNs; Graph neural networks; Graph representation learning","Crime; Deep learning; Finance; Graph neural networks; Learning systems; 'current; Anomaly detection; Finance industries; Financial fraud; Financial fraud detections; Graph representation; Graph representation learning; Systematic Review","This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grant ( RGPIN-2023-03733 ).","","Elsevier Ltd","09574174","","ESAPE","","English","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183771318"

Arguing that purely data-driven methods may not perform well for congestion forecasting, we propose a deep marked graph process model for predicting the congestion indices and the occurrence time of traffic congestion events for complex signalized road networks. Traffic congestion is considered as a nonrigorous spatiotemporal extreme event. We extend the traditional point process model by integrating a specially designed spatiotemporal graph convolutional network. This hybrid strategy takes advantage of the simple form of the point process model as well as the ability of graph neural networks to emulate the evolution of congestion. Experiments on real-world congestion data sets show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods, yielding satisfactory prediction results on a large signalized road network with superior computational efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Complex networks; Computational efficiency; Forecasting; Graph neural networks; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Stochastic systems; Complex evolutions; Congestion forecasting; Evolution patterns; Marked graphs; Model complexes; Point process; Process-models; Research problems; Road network; Signalised road networks; Traffic congestion; computer simulation; experimental study; forecasting method; numerical model; performance assessment; research work; spatiotemporal analysis; traffic congestion; transportation planning","The authors acknowledge\u00A0TU Wien Bibliothek\u00A0for financial support through its Open Access Funding Programme.

The development of modern Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has made it easier to collect large-scale individual-level human mobility data, however, the availability and usability of the raw data are still significantly limited due to privacy concerns, as well as issues of data redundancy, missing, and noise. Generating synthetic human mobility data through modeling approaches to statistically approximate the real data is a promising solution. From the data perspective, the generated human mobility data can serve as a substitute for real data, mitigating concerns about personal privacy and data security, and enhance the low- quality real data. From the modeling perspective, the constructed models for human mobility data generation can be used for scenario simulations and mechanism exploration. The human mobility data generation tasks include individual trajectory data generation and collective mobility data generation, and the research methods primarily consist of mechanistic models and machine learning models. This article firstly provides a systematic review of the research progress in human mobility data generation and then summarizes its development trends and challenges. It can be observed that mechanistic-model-based methods are predominantly studied in the field of statistical physics, while machine-learning-based methods are primarily studied in the field of computer science. Although the two types of models have complementary advantages, they are still developing independently. The article suggests that future research in human mobility data generation should focus on: 1) exploring and revealing the underlying mechanisms of human mobility behavior from a multidisciplinary perspective; 2) designing hybrid approaches by coupling machine learning and mechanistic models; 3) leveraging cutting- edge generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Model (LLM) technologies; 4) improving the models' spatial generalization and transfer-learning capabilities; 5) controlling the costs of model training and implementation; and 6) designing reasonable evaluation metrics and balancing data utility with privacy- preserving effectiveness. The article asserts that human mobility processes are typical phenomenon of human-environment interactions. On the one hand, research in Geographic Information Science (GIS) field should integrate with theories and technologies from other disciplines such as computer science, statistical physics, complexity science, transportation, and others. While on the other hand, research in GIS field should harness the unique characteristics of GIS by explicitly incorporating geographic spatial effects, including spatial dependency, distance decay, spatial heterogeneity, scale, and more into the modeling process to enhance the rationality and performance of the human mobility data generation models. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","generative AI; Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI); human mobility data; machine learning; mechanical model; privacy-preserving; synthetic data; trajectory generation","Balancing; Behavioral research; Geographic information systems; Privacy-preserving techniques; Statistical Physics; Generative artificial intelligence; Geo-spatial; Geospatial artificial intelligence; Human mobility; Human mobility data; Machine-learning; Mechanical modeling; Mobility datum; Privacy preserving; Synthetic data; Trajectory generation; Machine learning; artificial intelligence; data set; infectious disease; machine learning; mobility; public sector; transportation system; trend analysis","Funding text 1: [96] \u7A0B\u660C\u79C0,\u6C88\u77F3,\u674E\u5F3A\u5764.\u9EC4\u6CB3\u6D41\u57DF\u4EBA\u5730\u7CFB\u7EDF\u7814\u7A76\u7684\u5927\u6570\u636E \u652F\u6491\u4E0E\u65B9\u6CD5\u63A2\u7D22[J].\u4E2D\u56FD\u79D1\u5B66\u57FA\u91D1,2021,35(4):529- 536.[ChengCX,ShenS,LiQK.Bigdatasupportand methodexplorationaboutnaturalandhumansystemsre-searchintheY ellow RiverBasin[J].BulletinofNational Natural Science Foundation of China, 2021,35(4):529-536. ] DOI:10.16262/j.cnki.1000-8217.2021.04.005; Funding text 2: National Key Research and Development Program of China, No.2022YFB3904203; National Natural Science Foundation of China, No.42271474, 41901391.]","","Science Press","15608999","","","","Chinese","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193589829"

While they are effective in relieving chronic and acute pain, their narrow window of therapeutic use contributes to the high occurrence of abuse. The associated abuse of this family of drugs can be correlated to the increase in dependency, overdose, and death of users. The negative effects of opioids extend beyond the physical and psychological effects experienced by the user to their unregulated synthesis and sale, which contribute to socioeconomic challenges and are a biproduct of this global public health epidemic. From clinical to point-of-care applications, the detection and real-time monitoring of this family of drug is critical in the fight to decrease abuse and improve use in clinical settings. Chromatographic separations and chromatography–mass spectrometry are traditional methods of opioid analyses, but the high cost, long analysis time, and absence of portability highlight the need for the development of fast, in situ, point-of-care analysis, or of community drug monitoring services. This review highlights recent electrochemical and optical (FTIR, Raman, colorimetric, and fluorescent) advances and biosensors for pharmaceutical and illicit opioid analysis. Specifically, an emphasis is placed on the detection of opioids and their metabolites in biological samples and in vitro cellular assays for clinical diagnosis and forensic applications.

Unfortunately, some criminals abuse encrypted communications to conduct illegal activities, leading to the proliferation of the Darknet. To curb malicious darknet activities, the accurate and effective classification of darknet traffic is imperative. Considerable endeavors have been devoted to identifying the darknet traffic. However, the classification of darknet applications has not yielded a satisfactory result. This deficiency arises from the limitations of current approaches, e.g., some traditional methods rely on hand-crafted features that consume labor, and other neural network-based methods disregard the graph structure of the traffic. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Darknet Traffic Graph (DTG), a graph structure that captures the interactions between local clients and remote servers in darknet traffic.

Geographical artificial intelligence (GeoAI) is an emerging field that has contributed many new modeling approaches for spatiotemporal phenomena, especially spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs). However, there are two challenges to the prediction of human activity intensity. On the one hand, accurate predictions require modeling not only pairwise spatial relationships, e.g., distance and spatial flow but also complex high-order relationships, such as clusters and groups. On the other hand, it is not appropriate to incorporate prior knowledge on the spatial structure of data with subjective assumptions using graphs with predefined topologies or weights. To mitigate such challenges, a novel deep learning-based model was proposed, namely, the Hypergraph-based Hybrid Graph Convolutional Network (HyGCN). In our study, high-order relationships are modeled by hypergraph convolutions, and pairwise relationships are captured in graph convolutions. A spatial fusion layer is added to fuse the pairwise and high-order relationships. Then, adaptive graph and hypergraph generation methods are proposed to interpret edge weights and understand the learned geographic relationships in accordance with principles. After systematic experiments on large-scale mobility data, our results demonstrate that HyGCN outperforms state-of-the-art models. The learned geospatial knowledge can be disentangled and explained from the perspectives of geographic principles. This study offers new insights for not only revisiting geographic laws in GeoAI but also utilizing spatiotemporal knowledge in deep learning models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Explainable artificial intelligence; Graph convolutional network; High-order relationships; Human activity; Hypergraph; Spatial prediction","Deep learning; Forecasting; Graph neural networks; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Topology; Urban transportation; Convolutional networks; Explainable artificial intelligence; Graph convolutional network; High-order; High-order relationship; Higher-order; Human activities; Hybrid graphs; Hyper graph; Spatial prediction; Convolution","This work is supported by the New Faculty Set-up Funding, University of Minnesota ( 1000-10964-20042-5672018 ) and the Seed Grants for Social Sciences Research, OFAA, CLA, University of Minnesota ( 1000-10964-21297-5672018 ).

However, the detection accuracies of traditional models are limited due to their difficulty in capturing the periodicity and latent features from electricity consumption readings. To solve this problem, a graph attention network (GAT)-based model is proposed to improve the detection accuracy from a fresh viewpoint on graph domains. First, a new strategy is presented to transform raw one-dimensional electricity consumption readings into dynamic graphs, which represent the features and periodicity through feature matrices and correlation matrices, respectively.

Over the years, various models have been proposed, and spatial-temporal hypergraph learning models have recently shown outstanding performances. However, three correlations underlying crime are ignored, thus hindering the performance of previous models. Specifically, there are two spatial correlations and one temporal correlation, i.e., (1) co-occurrence of different types of crimes (type spatial correlation), (2) the closer to the crime center, the more dangerous it is around the neighborhood area (neighbor spatial correlation), and (3) the closer between two timestamps, the more relevant events are (hawkes temporal correlation). To this end, we propose Hawkes-enhanced Spatial-Temporal Hypergraph Contrastive Learning framework (HCL), which mines the aforementioned correlations via two specific strategies. Concretely, contrastive learning strategies are designed for two spatial correlations, and hawkes process modeling is adopted for temporal correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the promising capacities of HCL from four aspects, i.e., superiority, transferability, effectiveness, and sensitivity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Hyper graph; Learning frameworks; Performance; Public resources; Public safety; Resources optimization; Spatial correlations; Spatial temporals; Temporal correlations; Urban computing; Crime","This work is supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (No.2021YFB3100700) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 62325604, 62276271).","Wooldridge, M.; Dy, J.; Natarajan, S.","Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence","23743468; 21595399","9781577358879; 157735897X; 9781577358978; 1577358872; 9781577358800","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189637029"

Improving prediction accuracy by exploring stock correlations has received much attention in recent studies. However, there are still some issues that have not been fully considered, such as the impact of invalid correlations, low sensitivity to minor price fluctuations and dependence on priors expert information. To solve the above issues, we propose a novel spatial–temporal framework, which has several characteristics: (1) the noise-aware spatial–temporal attention that dynamically filters out invalid associations from traditional spatial attention and combines temporal attention to capture the spatial–temporal patterns of different stock series; (2) the adaptive stock hypergraph generation maps the intrinsic associations of stocks into a trainable dense matrix via adaptive node embedding; (3) the adaptive graph convolution extends the graph convolution operation from static graphs to adaptive hypergraphs for exploring the dynamic correlations. (4) Multiple stacked attention-based adaptive spatial–temporal Blocks form the end-to-end prediction framework, which uses time-aware cascaded convolution to extract fine-grained temporal features.

In the Spatial Transformer network, the self-attention mechanism is utilized to capture the global dependency of the power grid, while the graph convolutional layer is employed to establish the local dependency of the power grid. In the Temporal Transformer network, the self-attention mechanism is employed to capture the long-term sequence dependency of power grid data, overcoming the limitation of long short-term memory network (LSTM) which can only model limited temporal dependency. Therefore, the Spatial-Temporal Transformer network can effectively mine spatiotemporal features in power grid, improving detection accuracy.

The goal of this task is to generate accurate predictions concurrently for all regions within a city. Prior works take great effort on modeling the ST correlations. However, they often overlook intrinsic correlations and inherent data distribution across the city, both of which are influenced by urban zoning and functionality, resulting in inferior performance on citywide ST forecasting. In this paper, we introduce CityCAN, a novel causal attention network, to collectively generate predictions for every region of a city. We first present a causal framework to identify useful correlations among regions, filtering out useless ones, via an intervention strategy. In the framework, a Global Local-Attention Encoder, which leverages attention mechanisms, is designed to jointly learn both local and global ST correlations among correlated regions. Then, we design a citywide loss to constrain the prediction distribution by incorporating the citywide distribution.

To scientifically and reasonably predict money laundering risks, this paper focuses on the “layering” stage of the money laundering process in the field of supervised learning for money laundering fraud prediction. A money laundering and fraud prediction model based on deep learning, referred to as MDGC-LSTM, is proposed. The model combines the use of a dynamic graph convolutional network (MDGC) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to efficiently identify illegal money laundering activities within financial transactions. MDGC-LSTM constructs dynamic graph snapshots with symmetrical spatiotemporal structures based on transaction information, representing transaction nodes and currency flows as graph nodes and edges, respectively, and effectively captures the relationships between temporal and spatial structures, thus achieving the dynamic prediction of fraudulent transactions. The experimental results demonstrate that compared with traditional algorithms and other deep learning models, MDGC-LSTM achieves significant advantages in comprehensive spatiotemporal feature modeling.

However, this technological advancement has also created opportunities for malevolent behavior, with individuals exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to confidential data, obstruct activity, etc. To this end, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are needed to filter malicious traffic and prevent common attacks. In the past, these systems relied on a fixed set of rules or comparisons with previous attacks. However, with the increased availability of computational power and data, machine learning has emerged as a promising solution for this task. While many systems now use this methodology in real-time for a reactive approach to mitigation, we explore the potential of configuring it as a proactive time series prediction. In this work, we delve into this possibility further. More specifically, we convert a classic IDS dataset to a time series format and use predictive models to forecast forthcoming malign packets.

Both topics have been separately explored in the field of deep learning. For time-series modeling, recurrent neural networks or convolutional neural networks model the relations between values across timesteps, while for graph modeling, graph neural networks model the inter-relations between nodes. Recent research in deep learning requires simultaneous modeling for time-series and graphs when both representations are present. For example, both types of modeling are necessary for time-series classification, regression, and anomaly detection in graphs. This article aims to provide a comprehensive summary of these models, which we call graph time-series models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey article that provides a picture of related models from the perspective of deep graph time-series modeling to address a range of time-series tasks, including regression, classification, and anomaly detection. Graph time-series models are split into two categories: (a) graph recurrent/convolutional neural networks and (b) graph attention neural networks. Under each category, we further categorize models based on their properties.

Existing works mainly rely on the recurrent neural framework to encode the temporal dependencies in trajectories, have fall short in capturing spatial-temporal global context for TUL prediction. To fill this gap, this work presents a new hierarchical spatio-temporal attention neural network, called AttnTUL, to jointly encode the local trajectory transitional patterns and global spatial dependencies for TUL. Specifically, our first model component is built over the graph neural architecture to preserve the local and global context and enhance the representation paradigm of geographical regions and user trajectories. Additionally, a hierarchically structured attention network is designed to simultaneously encode the intra-trajectory and inter-trajectory dependencies, with the integration of the temporal attention mechanism and global elastic attentional encoder.

To ensure the accuracy of medicare fraud detection, one needs to explore the patient information in the data fully. However, many detection models have poor generalization ability and degraded performance when dealing with medicare imbalanced datasets that lack fraud samples. Therefore, this paper proposes a medicare fraud detection method based on weighted GraphSAGE and generative adversarial network. This method combines the representation of relationship features of patient visits with weighted GraphSAGE algorithm-based patient feature extraction and employs generative adversarial network to construct detection models. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the recognition performance of the model. Meanwhile, we compare the proposed method with advanced mainstream recognition techniques such as meta-path vectors, convolutional neural network, graph attention network, heterogeneous graph attention network and one-class adversarial nets. The proposed recognition method performs better in Recall, Precision, F1-score and Accuracy. Moreover, its performance remains stable under different data sizes and various positive and negative sample ratios, offering better generalization. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","generative adversarial network; imbalanced datasets; medicare fraud detection; patient access network; weighted GraphSAGE","Convolutional neural networks; Crime; Feature extraction; Health insurance; Access network; Detection methods; Detection models; Fraud detection; Imbalanced dataset; Medicare fraud detection; Patient access; Patient access network; Performance; Weighted GraphSAGE; Generative adversarial networks","Funding text 1: 作者简介: 陈妍 (1981–), 女, 汉, 教授, 研究生导师, 研究方向: 智慧医疗, 健康大数据分析与智能决策, 医疗服务智能管 理, E-mail: yanchen@hnu.edu.cn; 通信作者: 孙玉姣 (1990–), 女, 汉, 讲师, 博士, 研究方向: 服务能力优化, 机器学习算 法, E-mail: sunyujiao@126.com. 基金项目: 国家自然科学基金 (71971080, 62273140, 72201104); 国家杰出青年科学基金 (71925002) Foundation item: National Natural Science Foundation of China (71971080, 62273140, 72201104); National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (71925002) 中文引用格式: 陈妍, 张小威, 金赞, 等. 基于加权 GraphSAGE 和生成对抗网络的医保欺诈识别方法 [J]. 系统工程理论 与实践, 2024, 44(2): 732–751. 英文引用格式: Chen Y, Zhang X W, Jin Z, et al.

As cyber attacks are becoming more intelligent and accessible, I5 security issues are gaining increasing prominence. An intrusion detection system plays an important role in network security by detecting and identifying various security threats. However, owing to the limited computing and storage resources of users, it is difficult for I5 nodes to support large-scale network data collection and simultaneous transmission of the collected data. To address the above problems, this study investigates an intelligent intrusion detection technology for I5 security and develops a low-loss intrusion detection algorithm based on abnormal attacks. We first establish an incremental update feature selection method, which realises feature selection using a fuzzy rough set and a fuzzy knowledge distance. Subsequently, to reduce the decision loss of the selected features, we implement feature correlation using the fuzzy knowledge distance. Based on the selected features, we achieve incremental update intrusion detection using a graph attention network and a random forest. Simultaneously, we prove the convergence of the designed graph attention network in a specific scene.

In addition, cellular automata (CA) are a formalism that has received significant attention in recent decades as a model for investigating patterns in the dynamic spatio-temporal behavior of these systems, based on local rules. Some studies investigate the use of cellular automata to analyze the dynamic behavior of networks and refer to them as network automata (NA). Recently, it has been demonstrated that NA is effective for network classification, as it employs a Time-Evolution Pattern (TEP) for feature extraction. However, the TEPs investigated in previous studies consist of binary values (states) that do not capture the intrinsic details of the analyzed network. Therefore, in this work, we propose alternative sources of information that can be used as descriptors for the classification task, which we refer as Density Time-Evolution Pattern (D-TEP) and State Density Time-Evolution Pattern (SD-TEP). We examine the density of alive neighbors of each node, which is a continuous value, and compute feature vectors based on histograms of TEPs. Our results demonstrate significant improvement over previous studies on five synthetic network datasets, as well as seven real datasets.

Effectively mining relationships between MTS variables remains challenging as variables may imply multiple relational patterns. Recently, graph-based approaches have exhibited substantial effectiveness in capturing relationships between MTS variables. However, these methods often adhere to the paradigm of capturing low-level pairwise relationships, which limits their ability to capture other high-level beyond pairwise relational patterns. To address this issue, we present a synergistic graph learning framework that combines the modeling advantages of graphs and hypergraphs to uncover more comprehensive relational patterns. This framework mainly consists of two parts. Firstly, we introduced a Synergistic Relation Construction module, which incorporates dynamic graph and hypergraph structures to model low-level pairwise and high-level beyond pairwise relationships among variables, representing multi-level relational patterns through obtained adjacency matrices and incidence matrices. Additionally, we developed a Synergistic Relation Learning mechanism, that leverages novel synergistic graph and hypergraph convolutional networks to facilitate spatial dependency interactions across multi-levels, along with temporal convolutional networks to capture more comprehensive spatial-temporal dependencies. We conducted comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Graph neural network; Hypergraph neural network; Multi-level relational learning; Multivariate time series forecasting","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Federated learning; Graph neural networks; Holmium alloys; Network theory (graphs); Time series; Hyper graph; Hypergraph neural network; Multi-level relational learning; Multilevels; Multivariate time series; Multivariate time series forecasting; Neural-networks; Relational learning; Time series forecasting; Convolutional neural networks","We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful discussion and feedback.

Despite the richness of textual data as a source for event detection, it is challenging to extract contextual information from documents due to their complex structure and the dynamic evolution of events. In response to this challenge, dynamic Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising tool for capturing the intricate patterns embedded within textual data graphs. Nevertheless, many models in this domain primarily rely on local node-level representations, overlooking the essential global graph-level context. However, both node-level and graph-level representations are critical for effective event prediction. Node-level representations provide insight into the local structure, while graph-level representations offer an understanding of the global structure and the evaluation of temporal graphs. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Dynamic Graph Contrastive Learning (DyGCL) method for event prediction. Our model DyGCL first employs a local view encoder to effectively capture the local dynamic structure of input graphs as the evolving node representations. Then, it performs a global view encoder to perceive the hierarchical dynamic graph representation of the input graphs. Finally, the graph representations from both encoders, optimized via contrastive learning, are combined with an attention mechanism and utilized to predict future events.

Promptly detecting and efficiently handling clues of illegal hazardous waste activities have become major challenges for environmental law enforcement in current situation. This study, in the context of an information-based management model, proposes an intelligent identification technology framework for detecting hazardous waste environmental illegal activities. This framework is based on the integration of multi-source data, and aims to improve the detection and processing efficiency of environmental violations by constructing a multi-source database index system, developing key technologies for multi-source heterogeneous data integration and pre-processing, establishing an early warning model for hazardous waste environmental violations, and formulating early warning rules and confirmation mechanisms. Finally, with regard to cross-departmental collaborative law enforcement, some suggestions are put forward to clarify the rules for the transmission of illegal activity clues, unify the data processing and application standards, and establish a cross-departmental data sharing mechanism.

Detecting suspicious networks of individuals involved in credit, loans, and insurance claims is crucial for fraud prevention in the financial and insurance domain.

Taking this novel approach enables us to share insights into the advantages and practical challenges of using GNNs. The classification results reveal that node-level classification with network background is superior to conventional classification without network background.

However, many recommender systems overlook the valuable insights embedded in user reviews, thereby missing out on potential improvements. By incorporating review text into the recommendation process, it is possible to enhance the performance of recommender systems and tackle the Cold Start problem. In this study, a novel personalized method for recommending Points of Interest (POI) trips based on user reviews is proposed. The approach leverages a transformer model to extract semantic correlations in a multitask-learning setting, enabling predictions on crime rates and traffic flow at various POIs. Additionally, an LSTM network is employed to identify similar users based on their feedback, thereby overcoming data scarcity and the Cold Start issue. Moreover, this method incorporates multifaceted contextual information to determine user preferences accurately. Finally, a neural hybrid framework mines personalized POIs in a sequential pattern and integrates them into the recommendation process to identify the most efficient trip candidates. The proposed methodology is evaluated using datasets from Yelp, Gowalla, and Tripadvisor, and its superior performance is demonstrated across multiple evaluation metrics, including MAP, NDCG, RMSE, and F-Score. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Multi-objective recommender system; Personalization; Risk-aware; Social networks; Transformer; User feedback","Economic and social effects; Multi objective; Multi-objective recommender system; Personalizations; Risk aware; Risk factors; Social network; Transformer; User feedback; User reviews; User's risks; Reviews","","","Springer","13895753","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213025297"

The crux lies in extracting patterns or insights from cybersecurity data to build data-driven models, thus making the security systems automated and intelligent. To comprehend and analyze cybersecurity data, several Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods such as Machine Learning (ML) techniques, are employed to monitor network environments and actively combat cyber threats. This study explored the various AI techniques and how they are applied in cybersecurity. A comprehensive literature review was conducted, including a bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Using data extracted from two main scholarly databases: Clarivate’s Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus, this article examines relevant academic literature to understand the diverse ways in which AI techniques are employed to strengthen cybersecurity measures. These applications range from anomaly detection and threat identification to predictive analytics and automated incident response. A total of 14,509 peer-reviewed research papers were identified of which 9611 were from the Scopus database and 4898 from the WoS database. These research papers were further filtered, and a total of 939 relevant papers were eventually selected and used.

Recent works have employed spatial-temporal graph neural networks to model complex spatio-temporal relationships in forecasting tasks. However, the representation capacity of intricate spatio-temporal relationships remains a bottleneck in current approaches. They both fail to capture non-pairwise spatiotemporal relationships and establish real-time dynamic graph structures. Subsequently, with the great advances in generative graph self-supervised learning, particularly in masked graph autoencoders, it has become possible to construct spatio-temporal representations through generative graph self-supervised learning. Nevertheless, compared with the general applications of masked graph autoencoders in other graph tasks, spatio-temporal forecasting is more complex and requires further architectural design. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called Self-Supervised Masked Hypergraph Autoencoders for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting (MAE-ST). Our method introduces a masked hypergraph autoencoder that models both spatial and temporal dependencies as hypergraph structures and incorporates a special remasking strategy to regularize feature reconstruction. Additionally, we incorporate a real-time dynamic hypergraph structure to capture real-time dynamics and nonpairwise spatio-temporal dependencies. We evaluate our proposed method on four public datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the prediction performance of downstream spatio-temporal forecasting methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","hypergraph; masked autoencoders; spatio-temporal forecasting","Graph neural networks; Supervised learning; Auto encoders; Critical researches; Hyper graph; Masked autoencoder; Real-time dynamics; Research areas; Spatial temporals; Spatio-temporal forecasting; Spatio-temporal relationships; Urban environments; Self-supervised learning","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9780780390485; 9781509060146; 0780314212; 9781479914845; 9780738133669; 9781467314909; 9780780314214; 9781728119854; 0780390482; 9781665488679","85OFA","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205022814"

Traffic flow prediction is a critical task, and accurate traffic prediction can reduce traffic congestion and improve the operational efficiency of the transportation system. Existing models use given spatial adjacency graphs and sophisticated mechanisms to model spatial and temporal correlations and obtain good results. However, most of them rely on predefined graph structures or only consider the dynamic changes of temporal relations and ignore the dynamic changes of spatial relations. In order to solve these problems, this study proposes a spatio-temporal dynamically fused graph-convolutional network(STDFGCN) for traffic prediction. Unlike traditional models, our model does not rely on predefined graph structure but pays more attention to the dynamic changes of spatial relations and has a more vital adaptive ability to effectively capture and fuse the dynamically changing features of temporal relations and spatial relations. The model can understand the complexity of the urban transportation system more comprehensively, improving the prediction performance and enhancing traffic prediction ability.

Our goal is to better understand user behaviour in order to be better equipped to combat this issue.

There have been significant strides in recent years, but even state-of-the-art (SoTA) models rely heavily on domain specific supervised fine-tuning of visual features, and even with this data- and compute-intensive fine-tuning, overall performance can still be limited. We argue that the next generation of HAR models could benefit from explicit neuro-symbolic mechanisms in order to flexibly exploit rich contextual information available in, and for, videos. With a view to this, we propose a Human Activity Recognition with Context Prompt (HARCP) task to investigate the value of contextual information for video-based HAR. We also present a neuro-symbolic graph neural network-based framework that integrates zero-shot object localisation to address the HARCP task. This captures the human activity as a sequence of graph-based scene representations relating parts of the human body to key objects, supporting the targeted injection of external contextual knowledge in symbolic form. We evaluate existing HAR baselines alongside our graph-based methods to demonstrate the advantage of being able to accommodate this additional channel of information. Our evaluations show that not only does context information from key objects boost accuracy beyond that provided by SoTA HAR models alone, there is also a greater semantic similarity between our model’s errors and the target class. We argue that this represents an improved model alignment with human-like errors and quantify this with a novel measure we call Semantic Prediction Dispersion. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","context; graph neural network; human activity recognition; human alignment; neuro-symbolic integration","Human form models; Network theory (graphs); Context; Context information; Fine tuning; Graph neural networks; Graph-based; Human activity recognition; Human alignment; Neuro-symbolic integration; State of the art; Symbolic integration","","Besold, T.R.; d’Avila Garcez, A.; Jimenez-Ruiz, E.; Madhyastha, P.; Wagner, B.; Confalonieri, R.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","16113349; 03029743","9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141; 9783031984136","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204543241"

To this end, a multi-scale decomposition module based on improved empirical mode decomposition is proposed and combined with generalized likelihood theory to construct a time series analysis model. The dataset decomposition experiment showed that the improved empirical mode decomposition proposed in the study had certain advantages in the decomposition performance of the three datasets, but it was difficult to judge the difference between normal time series and time series data with anomalies only from the perspective of periodicity. The validation experiment of anomaly detection in the time series analysis model showed that applying data augmentation effectively improved the detection performance of the time series analysis model. Compared with other methods, the proposed time series analysis model had an increase in true class rate of 1.23%–5.13%, and a decrease in false positive class rate of 19.05%–4.00%. Feature selection effectively improved the anomaly detection ability of temporal analysis technology, and the true class rate of temporal analysis technology based on feature selection increased by 1.27%–8.96%. Ranking temporal data according to feature importance for anomaly detection effectively increased the effectiveness of anomaly detection. The True Positive Rate (TPR) value of anomaly detection for temporal data with the highest feature importance was as high as 0.93. The results indicate that improved empirical mode decomposition can effectively meet the temporal data decomposition of high latitude network behavior characteristics, and the proposed temporal analysis model has better applicability and efficiency in temporal data anomaly detection. The temporal analysis model based on improved empirical mode has a more accurate recognition rate and lower false alarm rate in dealing with temporal data anomaly detection in different network environments, and has certain practical value in the field of network security behavior anomaly detection. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","channel integration; data augmentation; Empirical mode decomposition; generalized likelihood ratio; time series data analysis; TPR","Time series analysis; Variational mode decomposition; Analysis models; Anomaly detection; Channel integration; Data augmentation; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Generalized likelihood ratio; Temporal analysis; Temporal Data; Time series data analysis; True positive rates; Empirical mode decomposition","","","River Publishers","22454578; 22451439","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203248223"

The taxonomy is based on a tri-level hierarchy, starting with the methodology category and narrowing down to specific techniques. Such a framework allows for a structured and comprehensive classification of algorithms, assisting researchers in understanding the interrelationships among diverse algorithms and techniques. Covering a wide range of algorithms, this taxonomy first categorizes algorithms into four main analysis types: user and item similarity based methods, hybrid and combined approaches, deep learning and algorithmic methods, and mathematical modeling methods, with further subdivisions into sub-categories and techniques. The paper incorporates both empirical and experimental evaluations to differentiate between the techniques. The empirical evaluation ranks the techniques based on four criteria. The experimental assessments rank the algorithms that belong to the same category, sub-category, technique, and sub-technique.

Due to the complex investment, supply and other relationships among financial event entities, existing research on financial risk prediction often employs various static and dynamic graph structures to model the relationship among financial entities. Meanwhile, convolutional graph neural networks and other methods are adopted to embed relevant graph structure information into the feature representation of financial entities, which enables the representation of both semantic and structural information related to financial risks. However, previous reviews of financial risk prediction only focus on studies based on static graph structures, but ignore the characteristics that the relationship among entities in financial events will change dynamically over time, which reduces the accuracy of risk prediction results. With the development of temporal graph neural networks, increasingly more studies have begun to pay attention to financial risk prediction based on dynamic graph structures, and a systematic and comprehensive review of these studies will help learners foster a complete understanding of financial risk prediction research. According to different methods to extract temporal information from dynamic graphs, this study first reviews three different neural network models for temporal graphs. Then, based on different graph learning tasks, it introduces the research on financial risk prediction in four areas, including stock price trend risk prediction, loan default risk prediction, fraud transaction risk prediction, and money laundering and tax evasion risk prediction. Finally, the difficulties and challenges facing the existing temporal graph neural network models in financial risk prediction are summarized, and potential directions for future research are prospected. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","financial risk prediction; loan default risk; money laundering; stock price trend risk; tax evasion risk; temporal graph neural network (TGNN); transaction fraud risk","Convolutional neural networks; Crime; Decentralized finance; Prediction models; Taxation; Default risk; Financial risk prediction; Financial risks; Fraud risk; Graph neural networks; Loan default; Loan default risk; Price trends; Risk predictions; Stock price; Stock price trend risk; Tax evasion risk; Tax evasions; Temporal graph neural network; Temporal graphs; Transaction fraud risk","","","Chinese Academy of Sciences","10009825","","RUXUE","","Chinese","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201712775"

The fast flow of information and the enormous number of users opens the door to the publication of non-truthful news, which has the potential to reach many people. Disseminating this news through low- or no-cost channels resulted in a flood of fake news that is difficult to detect by humans. Social media networks are one of these channels that are used to quickly spread this fake news by manipulating it in ways that influence readers in many aspects. That influence appears in a recent example amid the COVID-19 pandemic and various political events such as the recent US presidential elections. Given how this phenomenon impacts society, it is crucial to understand it well and study mechanisms that allow its timely detection. Deep learning (DL) has proven its potential for multiple complex tasks in the last few years with outstanding results. In particular, multiple specialized solutions have been put forward for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper, we systematically review existing fake news detection (FND) strategies that use DL techniques. We systematically surveyed the existing research articles by investigating the DL algorithms used in the detection process. Our focus then shifts to the datasets utilized in previous research and the effectiveness of the different DL solutions. Special attention was given to the application of strategies for transfer learning and dealing with the class imbalance problem. The effect of these solutions on the detection accuracy is also discussed. Finally, our survey provides an overview of key challenges that remain unsolved in the context of FND. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification; deep learning; fake news; misinformation; systematic literature review","Deep learning; Fake detection; Job analysis; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Accuracy; Classification algorithm; Fake news; Misinformation; Systematic literature review; Task analysis; Transfer learning; COVID-19","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","21693536","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200253242"

Graph data have been gradually applied in the field of trajectory data processing due to their advantages in easy construction and ability to solve complex relationship problems quickly. However, existing algorithms that combine graph data for trajectory data processing only consider movement patterns and traffic from a spatial perspective, with less attention paid to human behavioral characteristics. The algorithm for processing trajectory data is complex and lacks interpretability when faced with results.

Big data, information analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI) have become the basis for making strategic decisions in many sensitive areas, such as fraud detection, risk management, medical diagnosis, and counter-terrorism. However, there is still a need to assess how terrorist attacks are related, initiated, and detected. For this purpose, we propose a novel framework for classifying and predicting terrorist attacks. The proposed framework posits that neglected text attributes included in the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) can influence the accuracy of the model’s classification of terrorist attacks, where each part of the data can provide vital information to enrich the ability of classifier learning. Each data point in a multiclass taxonomy has one or more tags attached to it, referred as “related tags.” We applied machine learning classifiers to classify terrorist attack incidents obtained from the GTD. A transformer-based technique called DistilBERT extracts and learns contextual features from text attributes to acquire more information from text data. The extracted contextual features are combined with the “key features” of the dataset and used to perform the final classification. The study explored different experimental setups with various classifiers to evaluate the model’s performance. The experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms the latest techniques for classifying terrorist attacks with an accuracy of 98.7% using a combined feature set and extreme gradient boosting classifier. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; data analytic; DistilBERT; feature extraction; GTD dataset; machine learning; natural language processing; terrorism classification","Contrastive Learning; Risk management; Terrorism; Data analytics; Distilbert; Features extraction; Global terrorism; Global terrorism database dataset; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Terrorism classification; Adversarial machine learning","The authors would like to acknowledge the comments and suggestions given by anonymous reviewers.

Efficient and effective analysis of spatiotemporal data can help extract crucial information in diversified areas such as transportation, climate and weather, the environment, human mobility, public safety, neuroscience, and epidemiology. However, with both spatial and temporal attributes, spatiotemporal data is more complex in nature, making it unique from other types of data. Consequently, additional challenges arise when working with this special data type. Nevertheless, in this era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), researchers have been relentlessly working on developing improved methods that are successful in solving various problems that require unveiling spatiotemporal patterns in the data. In this chapter, we have attempted to provide a comprehensive discussion on spatiotemporal data. We explore both traditional machine learning techniques and the currently preferred deep learning methods that are well-suited for specific problems associated with distinct types, instances, and formats of spatiotemporal data.

Though great efforts have been made on traffic forecasting, existing works still have the following shortcomings: i) Most methods only directly perform on the original road network topology which cannot accommodate the diverse traffic patterns and multi-granularity traffic forecasting requirements driven by the natural multi-level urban structure and layout, ii) The existing studies based on the spatio-temporal multi-granularity perspective ignore the interactions between the fine-grained information and coarse-grained information, resulting in the spatio-temporal correlation under multi-granularity inaccurately modeled. To solve the problems, we propose an Adaptive and Interactive Multi-level Spatio-Temporal network (AIMST) for traffic forecasting. Specifically, we first devise a learnable adaptive hierarchical clustering method to automatically generate more coarse-grained graphs from the initial road networks and the traffic data. Then, the spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks are executed on the constructed hierarchical traffic graph of each level correspondingly to capture the spatio-temporal patterns. Furthermore, a multi-level bidirectional interaction module is designed to emphasize the multi-grained interaction patterns among different levels. Extensive experiments on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that our framework is superior to several state-of-the-art baselines. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","multi-level traffic network; Spatio-temporal data mining; traffic forecasting; urban computing","Adaptive control systems; Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Motor transportation; Network topology; Roads and streets; Traffic control; Correlation; Layout; Multi-level traffic network; Multilevels; Road; Spatio-temporal data mining; Traffic Forecasting; Traffic networks; Urban areas; Urban computing; Forecasting","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 12227901 and Grant 62072427, in part by the Project of Stable Support for Youth Team in Basic Research Field, in part by Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) under Grant YSBR-005, in part by the Academic Leaders Cultivation Program, and in part by the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).; Funding text 2: Manuscript received 20 July 2023; revised 26 December 2023 and 16 April 2024; accepted 19 April 2024.

The proliferation of fake news across various social media platforms poses enormous harm to society and affects the news industry’s credibility. Therefore, it is critical to develop effective automated algorithms to detect deceptive articles. We show that existing models for fake news detection based on deep learning have limitations in terms of generalizability when confronted with a variety of news sources. Current deep learning models frequently fail to generalize adequately across different datasets, resulting in inferior performance. In this paper, we investigate the performance of numerous deep learning models on multiple fake news datasets, each with distinct characteristics. Our goal is to assess these models’ performance within the same dataset and across other datasets in the domain of fake news. We aim to acquire useful insights into the models’ robustness and generalizability across multiple datasets. We carried out an extensive set of experiments with five deep-learning models and seven datasets. These models are tested within a domain and across domains, i.e., on the same domain where they are trained and on other domains that were not seen during training. Our results show that these models cannot be generalized over various datasets and domains. The results reveal that these models exhibit high accuracy (around 99%) when tested on the dataset they were trained on but they experience a significant drop in performance (around 30%) when evaluated on different datasets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cross-domain; Deep learning; Fake news detection","Fake detection; Learning systems; Social networking (online); 'current; Automated algorithms; Cross-domain; Deep learning; Fake news detection; Learning models; News sources; Performance; Social media; Social media platforms","","Mosbah, M.; Ahmed, T.; Sèdes, F.; Tawbi, N.; Boulahia-Cuppens, N.; Garcia-Alfaro, J.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","16113349; 03029743","9789819698936; 9789819698042; 9789819698110; 9789819698905; 9789819512324; 9783032026019; 9783032008909; 9783031915802; 9789819698141; 9783031984136","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192851118"

Indeed, different correlations and influences arise in a dynamic traffic network, making modeling a complicated task. Existing literature has proposed many different methods to capture traffic networks’ complex underlying spatial-temporal relations. However, given the heterogeneity of traffic data, consistently capturing both spatial and temporal dependencies presents a significant challenge. Also, as more and more sophisticated methods are being proposed, models are increasingly becoming memory-heavy and, thus, unsuitable for low-powered devices. To this end, we propose Spatio-Temporal Lightweight Graph GRU, namely STLGRU, a novel traffic forecasting model for predicting traffic flow accurately. Specifically, our proposed STLGRU can effectively capture dynamic local and global spatial-temporal relations of traffic networks using memory-augmented attention and gating mechanisms in a continuously synchronized manner. Moreover, instead of employing separate temporal and spatial components, we show that our memory module and gated unit can successfully learn the spatial-temporal dependencies with reduced memory usage and fewer parameters. Extensive experimental results on three real-world public traffic datasets demonstrate that our method can not only achieve state-of-the-art performance but also exhibit competitive computational efficiency.

Many researchers have been working to develop WS-VAD systems using various technologies by assessing anomaly scores. However, they are still facing challenges because of lacking effective feature extraction. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a multi-stage deep-learning model for separating abnormal events from normality to extract the hierarchical effective features. In the first stage, we extract two stream features using pre-trained techniques: the first stream employs a ViT-based CLIP module to select top-k features, while the second stream utilizes a CNN-based I3D module integrated into the Temporal Contextual Aggregation (TCA) mechanism. These features are concatenated and fed into the second-stage module, where an Uncertainty-regulated Dual Memory Units (UR-DMU) model is employed to learn representations of regular and abnormal data simultaneously. The UR-DMU integrates global and local structures, leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Global and Local Multi-Head Self Attention (GL-MHSA) modules to capture video associations. Subsequently, feature reduction is achieved using the multilayer-perceptron (MLP) integration with the Prompt-Enhanced Learning (PEL) module via the knowledge-based prompt. Finally, we employed a classifier module to predict the snippet-level anomaly scores. In the training phase, the based function transfers the snippet-level scores into bag-level predictions for learning high activation in anomalous cases. Our approach integrates these cutting-edge technologies and methodologies, offering a comprehensive solution to video-based anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on ShanghaiTech, XD-Violence, and UCF-Crime datasets validate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches by a substantial margin. We believe that our model holds significant promise for real-world applications, demonstrating superior performance and efficacy in anomaly detection tasks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","graph convolutional networks and global/local multi-head self-attention (GL-MHSA); Temporal contextual aggregation (TCA); uncertainty-regulated dual memory units (UR-DMU); weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) anomaly detection","Convolution; Deep learning; Extraction; Feature extraction; Knowledge based systems; Security systems; Uncertainty analysis; Anomaly detection; Computational modelling; Convolutional networks; Convolutional neural network; Features extraction; Global-local; Graph convolutional network and global/local multi-head self attention; Graph neural networks; Memory units; Task analysis; Temporal contextual aggregation; Uncertainty; Uncertainty-regulated dual memory unit; Weakly supervised video anomaly detection anomaly detection; Semantics","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192202801"

The United Nations (UN) estimates that 2 to 5% of global GDP, which is approximately 0.8 to 2.0 trillion dollars, is laundered globally every year. Therefore, accurately identifying such globally alarming activities is crucial for enforcing anti-money laundering (AML) measures. Numerous techniques have been proposed to detect money laundering from transaction graphs of money transfers between bank accounts by analysing the structural and behavioural dynamics of their corresponding dense subgraphs. However, these techniques often do not consider that money laundering usually involves high-volume flows of funds through chains of bank accounts. Moreover, most AML approaches either result in lower detection accuracy or incur higher computational costs, making them less reliable and suitable for real financial systems. Consequently, only a fraction of money laundering activities can be detected and prevented. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach to AML by employing semi-supervised graph learning techniques on a large-scale financial transactional graph in both pipeline settings (i.e., graph embedding models are first trained to generate node embeddings that are combined with additional topological graph features to train binary classifiers) and end-to-end settings (i.e., node classification is performed by training SkipGCN, FastGCN, and EvolveGCN without requiring separate classifiers) to identify nodes involved in potential money laundering activities. We evaluate our approach on four datasets: AMLSim, Elliptic, IBM AML, and SynthAML, with a view to scalability and practicality for real financial systems. Further, we provide local (e.g., how money is laundered between nodes) and global (e.g., what factors contribute to money laundering) explanations of the predictions by highlighting the predominant factors in money laundering cases and elucidating the mechanisms of illicit fund transfers between nodes to enhance the interpretability and transparency of the AML models. Experimental results suggest that our approach is scalable and effective at detecting money laundering from real and synthetic transaction graphs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anti-money laundering; graph embedding; machine learning on graphs","Crime; Flow graphs; Learning algorithms; Supervised learning; Anti-money laundering; Bank accounts; Fraud; Graph embeddings; Learning techniques; Machine learning on graph; Machine-learning; Semi-supervised graphs; Semi-supervised learning; Synthetic data; Finance","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189618024"

Individuals often place unwavering trust in social networks, often without discerning the origins and authenticity of the information disseminated through these platforms. Hence, the identification of media-rich fake news necessitates an approach that adeptly leverages multimedia elements and effectively enhances detection accuracy. The ever-changing nature of cyberspace highlights the need for measures that may effectively resist the spread of media-rich fake news while protecting the integrity of information systems. This study introduces a robust approach for fake news detection, utilizing three publicly available datasets: WELFake, FakeNewsNet, and FakeNewsPrediction. We integrated FastText word embeddings with various Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods, further refining these algorithms with regularization and hyperparameter optimization to mitigate overfitting and promote model generalization. Notably, a hybrid model combining Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory, enriched with FastText embeddings, surpassed other techniques in classification performance across all datasets, registering accuracy and F1-scores of 0.99, 0.97, and 0.99, respectively. Additionally, we utilized state-of-the-art transformer-based models such as BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa, enhancing them through hyperparameter adjustments. These transformer models, surpassing traditional RNN-based frameworks, excel in managing syntactic nuances, thus aiding in semantic interpretation.

Dynamic graphs efficiently handle applications such as social network prediction, recommender systems, traffic forecasting, or electroencephalography analysis, which cannot be addressed using standard numerical representations. As a direct consequence, dynamic graph learning has emerged as a new machine learning problem, combining challenges from both sequential/temporal data processing and static graph learning.

As such, many traffic prediction models have been proposed. The current methods commonly adopt graph convolution networks (GCNs) to capture spatial correlations. GCN-based approaches mainly focus on pair-wise interactions between road vertices (i.e. dyadic relations). However, the interactions between road vertices are not necessarily dyadic, but also can be high-order (i.e., multivariate relations). Further, few existing works focus on how to mine correlations between different types of traffic data. To this end, we develop STGHCN, a spatial-temporal gated hypergraph convolution network, that not only captures pair-wise and high-order spatial patterns between vertices but also characterizes the type-aware traffic data influences. Specifically, we adopt a spatial gated graph convolution and a hypergraph convolution to explore pair-wise and high-order interactions. More importantly, we design a spatial-temporal aware channel attention mechanism to mine hidden patterns between cross-type traffic features. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world traffic datasets validate the effectiveness of STGHCN, with STGHCN's MAE, RMSE, and MAPE at between 6.91%-10.00%, 5.42%-8.90%, and 2.54%-5.03% lower than the state-of-the-art methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Channel attention mechanism; hypergraph convolution; intelligent transportation systems; spatial-temporal correlations; traffic prediction","Computation theory; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Roads and streets; Traffic control; Attention mechanisms; Channel attention mechanism; Computational modelling; Correlation; Hyper graph; Hypergraph convolution; Intelligent transportation systems; Predictive models; Road; Spatial-temporal correlation; Traffic prediction; Convolution","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2022YFB3104502, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China underGrant U20A20177 andGrant 62272348, in part by theWuhan Science and Technology Joint Project for Building a Strong Transportation Country under Grant 2023-2-7, and in part by the NationalNatural Science Foundation ofChina under Grant 62302225.","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","00189545; 19399359","","ITVTA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187296295"

Fake base station (FBS) is the main channel for sending spam messages. Accurate spatiotemporal prediction of spam messages from FBS is important for implementing short-term spam prevention measures by the police. However, existing models used for spam messages modeling often focus on capturing spatial dependencies based on distance, thus failing to fully exploit spatial dependencies hidden in the data. Meanwhile, they encounter difficulties in mitigating the impact of excessive zero data. Therefore, based on the crowdsourced spam message data, a temporal graph-convolutional-network model (FBS-TGCN) is developed for the spatiotemporal prediction of spam messages from FBS. This model includes graph convolutional network (GCN) and gated temporal convolutional network (TCN) to capture the spatial and temporal dependencies alternatively. We further combine a weighted adjacency matrix and a self-adaptive adjacency matrix to capture both distance-based spatial dependencies and hidden spatial dependencies. A weighted loss function is used to mitigate the influence of excessive zero data. Experimental results using the spam dataset in Beijing demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model when compared to the baseline models, especially in the prediction of spam messages quantity and high spamming areas. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fake base stations; high spamming areas; spam messages; spatiotemporal modeling; temporal graph-convolutional-network","artificial neural network; experimental study; mobile communication; mobile phone; spatiotemporal analysis; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China","This research was funded by the Innovation Group Project of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai) [grant number 311022009], the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [grant number 2022B1515130001], and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 4197137] for Yufei\u00B7Shi, Haiyan Tao, Li Zhuo, Yiwei Ma, and Qingli Shi.","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","13658824; 13658816","","IGISF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183923537"

However, inferring unknown attributes of urban spatial units from data mining of spatial interaction remains a challenge in geographic information science. Although neural-network approaches have been widely applied to this field, urban dynamics, spatial semantics, and their relationship with urban functional features have not been deeply discussed. To this end, we proposed semantic-enhanced graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) to facilitate the multi-scale embedding of urban spatial units, based on which the identification of urban land use is achieved by leveraging the characteristics of human mobility extracted from the largest mobile phone datasets to date. Given the heterogeneity of multi-modal spatial data, we introduced the combination of a systematic data-alignment method and a generative feature-fusion method for the robust construction of heterogeneous graphs, providing an adaptive solution to improve GCNNs’ performance in node-classification tasks. Our work explicitly examined the scale effect on GCNN backbones, for the first time. The results prove that large-scale tasks are more sensitive to the directionality of spatial interaction, and small-scale tasks are more sensitive to the adjacency of spatial interaction. Quantitative experiments conducted in Shenzhen demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to state-of-the-art methods. The best accuracy is achieved by the inductive GraphSAGE model at the scale of 250 m, exceeding the baseline by 25.4%. Furthermore, we innovatively explained the role of spatial-interaction factors in the identification of urban land use through the deep learning method. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","feature fusion; graph convolutional neural networks; human mobility; semantic embedding; spatial interaction; urban land use","","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41925003, 42130402), the Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Program (RCBS20221008093330064), the Shenzhen Science and Technology Program (JCYJ20220818100810024), and the Introduction Project of Postdoctoral International Exchange Program (YJ20210217), the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2022A1515010696).","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","22209964","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183158404"

The cheating behavior detection model in examination invigilation systems plays a pivotal role in guaranteeing the equality of long-distance examinations. However, cheating behavior is rare, and most researchers do not comprehensively take into account features such as head posture, gaze angle, body posture, and background information in the task of cheating behavior detection.

This study proposes a new framework that enables the optimal deployment of police drones to address crime risk issues on urban street networks. This risk-based decision framework takes into account three potential distance metrics that regulate and shape the flying routes of drones, which in turn affects the optimal location of drone base stations. In addition, this framework takes into account the major risk constraints of flying drones in urban areas, including domestic privacy and elevation. The proposed risk-based decision framework is validated using the real case study of Liverpool with historical crime data and street network layouts.

Existing methods generally employ aggregated or raw features as their representations to train their detection models. Yet such features tend to fall short of effectively exposing the characteristics of various frauds. In this work, we propose a spatial-temporal gated network (STGN) to automatically learn new informative transactional representations containing users' transactional behavioral information for CCFD. A gated recurrent neural net unit is specifically constructed with a time-aware gate and location-aware gate to extract users' spatial and temporal transactional behaviors. A spatial-temporal attention module is designed to expose the transaction motive of users in their historical transactional behaviors, which allows the proposed model to better extract the fraudulent characteristics from successive transactions with time and location information. A representation interaction module is offered to make rational decisions and learn compositive transactional representations. A real-world transaction dataset is used in experiments to verify the efficacy of the learned new representations. The results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art ones, thus greatly advancing the field of CCFD. Note to Practitioners - The features of transaction records reflect the characteristics of users' transactional behaviors. Therefore, effective features are critical for accurate CCFD. However, fraudsters often pretend to be legitimate users during transactions to deceive the CCFD system. As a result, fraudulent behaviors become concealed within legitimate ones, signifying that original features are inadequate for accurate CCFD. Thus, it is imperative for researchers and practitioners to extract new features that can well expose fraud characteristics. While existing methods employing some transaction aggregation strategies can spot certain fraudulent behaviors, they fail to clearly cluster all the anomalous behaviors and distinguish them from legitimate behaviors. Therefore, this work is driven by the urgent demand to extract new informative features for CCFD. Its primary focus is to unveil the aggregation of fraudulent transactional behaviors from both temporal and spatial perspectives, enabling more accurate CCFD. Specifically, this work introduces a new STGN model that automatically learns new transactional representations incorporating users' transactional behavioral information for CCFD. By comprehensively considering the time interval and location interval of consecutive user transactions, we thoroughly reveal the temporal and spatial aggregation of fraudulent behavior, which provides valuable insights for CCFD practitioners: 1) employing features that integrate the behavioral characteristics of fraudsters instead of the original features can enhance the model's capability to identify frauds, and 2) taking into account the time and location intervals of users' consecutive historical transactions can better uncover the behavioral characteristics of fraudsters. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credit card fraud detection; gated recurrent networks; representation learning; transactional behavior","Behavioral research; Computer circuits; Crime; Logic gates; Recurrent neural networks; Behavioral science; Credit card fraud detections; Credit cards; Features extraction; Fraud; Gated recurrent network; Random forests; Recurrent networks; Representation learning; Transactional behavior; Feature extraction","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Plan under Grant 2021YFF0601200 and Grant 2021YFF0601204; in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61972241, Grant 62172299, and Grant 62172268; in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai under Grant 22ZR1427100; in part by the Shanghai Science and Technology Project under Grant 21JC1402800 and Grant 20040501500; in part by the Soft Science Project of Shanghai under Grant 23692106700; in part by the Key Projects of Natural Science Research in Anhui Higher Education Institutions under Grant 2022AH051909; and in part by the Bengbu University 2021 High- Level Scientific Research and Cultivation Project under Grant 2021pyxm04","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15455955","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179806178"

Forecasting the evolution patterns of spatio-temporal data is an important yet demanding aspect of urban computing, which can enhance intelligent management decisions in various fields, including transportation, environment, climate, public safety, healthcare, and others. Traditional statistical and deep learning methods struggle to capture complex correlations in urban spatio-temporal data. To this end, Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNN) have been proposed, achieving great promise in recent years. STGNNs enable the extraction of complex spatio-temporal dependencies by integrating graph neural networks (GNNs) and various temporal learning methods. In this manuscript, we provide a comprehensive survey on recent progress on STGNN technologies for predictive learning in urban computing. Firstly, we provide a brief introduction to the construction methods of spatio-temporal graph data and the prevalent deep-learning architectures used in STGNNs.

The integration of deep learning with socioenvironmental and geographical patterns and processes is still in an early phase. This study proposes a flexible framework that synthesizes computer vision with patterns and processes of geographical phenomena (e.g., urban redevelopment) via deep convolutional neural networks and spatiotemporal neighborhoods, respectively. Meanwhile, undesirable visual cues (e.g., temporary objects such as cars) cause false alarms in urban change detection. Thus, a masked deep pyramid similarity model (i.e., the computer vision model) is proposed to minimize the negative impact of nonbuilding changes. This pipeline has robustness against obfuscation of undesirable street scene changes and elasticity of geographical knowledge representations in mapping property redevelopment. This model is reproducible and adaptable due to the wide availability of SVI and flexibility of the framework. The results suggest that the domain-driven rules and nonbuilding change masking mechanism can significantly increase the accuracy of a computer vision model. We also find that urban redevelopment should be understood as a locally tuned back-to-the-city process with weak replicability. Hybrid gentrification (i.e., the combination of “seesaw” gentrification and continuous gentrification) is observed globally with local variations. Takeaway for practice: First, the population of those affected should be carefully identified and the benefits of gentrification need to be redistributed on a larger scale. For Auckland, decision-makers should not divert attention away from low-income tenants in outer suburbs that slipped below the radar of local government and scholars. Second, more attention should be given to less resourcing neighborhoods in constantly gentrifying neighborhoods when governments formulate and implement housing subsidy policies. Locally, incessant redevelopment in Auckland CBD, New Market and Remuera, etc., should be contained. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep learning; Gentrification; Physical urban change; Regeneration; Street view imagery","artificial neural network; computer simulation; gentrification; housing policy; image analysis; machine learning; mapping method; neighborhood; numerical model; policy implementation; redevelopment; remote sensing; subsidy system; suburban area; visualization; Auckland [Auckland (RGA)]; Auckland [North Island]; New Zealand; North Island","Funding text 1: We are grateful for the comments and help from two reviewers, the Editor (Professor Pengjun Zhao), the Associate Editor (Professor Simon Joss) and Professor Darren Smith on earlier drafts.

Most short-term forecasting models exclusively concentrate on the correlation of numerical weather prediction (NWP) with wind power, while ignoring the temporal autocorrelation of wind power. To take both of them into consideration, this paper proposes a continuous conditional random field (CCRF) model integrated with the bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) and Gaussian Kernels (GKs). Firstly, through establishing the weather research and forecasting model, NWP data of high temporal-spatial resolution are generated as the input features of forecasting model. Secondly, Bi-LSTM is employed as the unary potential function to construct the non-linear relationship of the feature sequence with the wind power sequence, and the pre-defined two GKs are supplemented as the pairwise potential function to learn the interaction of wind power sequence. Thirdly, with the two potential functions, the CCRF model is constructed and trained by applying the mean-field theory, avoiding the complex gradient derivation in the learning process. Finally, the proposed CCRF model is tested through case studies and the results show that the forecasting accuracy can exceed that of any selected benchmark model. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bidirectional LSTM; continuous conditional random field; Gaussian Kernel function; wind power forecast","Image segmentation; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Power generation; Random processes; Weather forecasting; Wind speed; Bidirectional LSTM; Biological system modeling; Continuous conditional random field; Gaussian kernel functions; Predictive models; Random fields; Wind forecasting; Wind power forecast; Wind power generation; Wind power","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","08858950","","ITPSE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159705750"

While a lot of research has been conducted regarding the posterior sampling and inference for NSPs, most of the existing methods only work for shallow NSPs (i.e., NSPs with one layer of latent Poisson processes). In this paper, we present virtual-event-based posterior sampling and inference algorithms for NSPs. The algorithms work for both deep NSPs and shallow NSPs. Moreover, we show that deep NSPs can be viewed as branching processes or a limiting case of probabilistic graphical models. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the convergence of our algorithms and provide the condition for the convergence to hold. In doing so, we also prove the convergence of virtual-event-based sampling inference algorithms for other point process models with missing information (Markov jump processes, piecewise-constant intensity models, and Hawkes processes). Like NSPs, the latent variables of these models with missing information are also point processes. Our experimental results demonstrate that the prediction based on our sampling and inference algorithms for NSPs can achieve good prediction performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","hierarchical model; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Neyman-Scott processes; point processes; variational inference","Inference engines; Markov chains; Monte Carlo methods; Poisson distribution; Virtual reality; Event-based; Hierarchical model; Inference algorithm; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Markov Chain Monte-Carlo; Neyman-scott process; Point process; Poisson process; Sampling algorithm; Variational inference; Hierarchical systems","This work was supported by the NSFC Projects (Nos. 62350080, 62106120), Tsinghua Institute for Guo Qiang, and the High Performance Computing Center, Tsinghua University.

The framework encodes local diffusion patterns and global spatial-temporal information to identify the most critical nodes underpinning these networks. Validated on real transaction data from the Israel-Palestine and Russia-Ukraine conflicts, the framework outperforms existing algorithms in pinpointing key nodes for dismantling the networks. Visualizations reveal how different entities like exchanges, payment processors, and fundraising addresses play crucial roles as financial hubs and obfuscation channels.

That is, a system that is secure or safe can be judged by whether the behavior of certain agent(s) is appropriate or not. Specifically, a so-called appropriate behavior involves the right agent performing the right actions at the right time under certain conditions. Then, according to different levels of appropriateness and degrees of custodies, behavioral authentication can be graded into three levels, i.e., the authentication of behavioral Identity, Conformity, and Benignity. In a broad sense, for the security and safety issue, behavioral authentication is not only an innovative and promising method due to its inherent advantages but also a critical and fundamental problem due to the ubiquity of behavior generation and the necessity of behavior regulation in any system. By this classification, this review provides a comprehensive examination of the background and preliminaries of behavioral authentication. It further summarizes existing research based on their respective focus areas and characteristics. The challenges confronted by current behavioral authentication methods are analyzed, and potential research directions are discussed to promote the diversified and integrated development of behavioral authentication. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anomaly detection; Artificial intelligence; Behavior modeling; Behavioral authentication; Machine learning; Security and safety","","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant 62372328, in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2022YFB4501704, in part by the Program of Shanghai Academic Research Leader under Grant 22XD1423700, in part by the Shanghai Science and Technology Innovation Action Plan Project under Grant 22511100700, in part by the Leadership Project under the Oriental Talent Program, and in part by the Open Fund of Key Laboratory of Industrial Internet of Things and Networked Control, Ministry of Education, under Grant 2021FF08.","","EDP Sciences","20972121; 28261275","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009741755"

In response, researchers have proposed centralized methods and federated learning to detect abnormal transactions. However, existing methods suffer from insufficient feature fusion, leading to information loss. In addition, the averaging of client parameters in federated learning negatively affects transaction detection effectiveness. To tackle these issues, we propose a Federated learning-based Multi-angle feature fusion framework for abnormal Transactions Detection, named FMTD. First, an Adaptive Multi-angle Contrastive Learning model (AMCL) is presented as the local model for clients, which improves feature fusion by maximizing positive sample consistency, minimizing negative sample consistency, and assigning higher weights to more effective features. Second, a Federated adaptive algorithm with Adjustable Client Weights (Fed-ACW) is introduced, which reduces the negative impact of poor local models on the global model. While preserving transaction feature privacy, FMTD enhances the transaction detection rate.

The development of substitutes and sustainable energy sources to replace fossil fuels has become a worldwide priority. Bio-electrochemical systems (BESs), employing redox reactions of electroactive microorganisms (EAMs) on electrodes to achieve a meritorious combination of biocatalysis and electrocatalysis, provide a green and sustainable alternative approach for bioremediation, CO<inf>2</inf> fixation, and energy and chemicals production. EAMs, including exoelectrogens and electrotrophs, perform extracellular electron transfer (EET) (i.e., outward and inward EET), respectively, to exchange energy with the environment, whose rate determines the efficiency and performance of BESs. Therefore, we review the synthetic biology strategies developed in the last decade for engineering EAMs to enhance the EET rate in cell-electrode interfaces for facilitating the production of electricity energy and value-added chemicals, which include (1) progress in genetic manipulation and editing tools to achieve the efficient regulation of gene expression, knockout, and knockdown of EAMs; (2) synthetic biological engineering strategies to enhance the outward EET of exoelectrogens to anodes for electricity power production and anodic electro-fermentation (AEF) for chemicals production, including (i) broadening and strengthening substrate utilization, (ii) increasing the intracellular releasable reducing equivalents, (iii) optimizing c-type cytochrome (c-Cyts) expression and maturation, (iv) enhancing conductive nanowire biosynthesis and modification, (v) promoting electron shuttle biosynthesis, secretion, and immobilization, (vi) engineering global regulators to promote EET rate, (vii) facilitating biofilm formation, and (viii) constructing cell-material hybrids; (3) the mechanisms of inward EET, CO<inf>2</inf> fixation pathway, and engineering strategies for improving the inward EET of electrotrophic cells for CO<inf>2</inf> reduction and chemical production, including (i) programming metabolic pathways of electrotrophs, (ii) rewiring bioelectrical circuits for enhancing inward EET, and (iii) constructing microbial (photo)electrosynthesis by cell-material hybridization; (4) perspectives on future challenges and opportunities for engineering EET to develop highly efficient BESs for sustainable energy and chemical production. We expect that this review will provide a theoretical basis for the future development of BESs in energy harvesting, CO<inf>2</inf> fixation, and chemical synthesis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Biochemical engineering; Biochemistry; Bioremediation; Biosynthesis; Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Cell engineering; Chemical modification; Chemical stability; Cost engineering; Electrochemical electrodes; Electron transitions; Energy efficiency; Energy harvesting; Fossil fuels; Gene expression; Microbial fuel cells; Molecular biology; Power generation; Redox reactions; Substrates; Synthetic biology; Bio-electrochemical systems; Cell-materials; Chemical production; Climate deterioration; Electro actives; Electron transfer pathways; Electron transfer rates; Energy productions; Extracellular electron transfer; Microorganisms; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; bioenergy; electron; electron transport; synthetic biology; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Carbon Dioxide; Electrodes; Electron Transport; Electrons; Fossil Fuels; Synthetic Biology","This research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2018YFA0901300), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC 32071411, 32001034, 21621004, and 22378305), Tianjin Science and Technology Plan Project (20JCQNJC00830), and the Foundation of Key Laboratory of Agro-Products Processing and Storage, Key Laboratory of Agro-products Quality and Safety Control in Storage and Transport Process, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, P.

There is an inequality in the spatio-temporal distribution of demand and supply, which requires the proper recommendation of routes to drivers in order to guide them towards riders optimally. This paper provides a review of different route recommendation strategies that have been applied in ride-hailing platforms with the main focus on fairness, and environmental issues. It is important to consider the environmental aspects of route recommendation systems as the transportation sector is one of the major sources of air pollution and has reduced the life expectancy of people around the globe. Moreover, there is an unfair distribution of resources and opportunities among the drivers and riders of the platform which has affected their long-term sustainability in the market. In this paper, we highlight the critical challenges and opportunities inherent in the design of green and fair route recommendation systems and indicate some possible directions for future research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","eco-friendly; fairness; optimization; ride-hailing; Route recommendation","Environmental protection; Sustainable development; Transportation routes; Urban transportation; Eco-friendly; Fairness; Means of transportations; Optimisations; Recommendation techniques; Ride-hailing; Route recommendation; Spatiotemporal distributions; Transportation system; Urban areas; Recommender systems","","","Association for Computing Machinery","21576904; 21576912","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183324041"

However，the solid data-fitting ability of deep learning hides the unexplained phenomenon of“shortcut learning”，which leads to the vulnerability of the deep model. Many studies have shown that if an attacker adds slight perturbations to normal data that human beings cannot perceive，the model may produce catastrophic wrong output，which severely limits the application of deep learning in security-sensitive fields. Therefore，to deal with the threat of malicious attacks，an antagonistic defense should be set up，and the robustness of the model should be improved. In this regard，researchers have proposed a variety of adversarial defense methods. The existing defense methods for deep neural networks can be divided into three categories，namely，modifying-input-data-based methods， directly-enhancing-network-based methods， and adversarial-training-based methods. Modifying-input-data-based defense methods aim to alter the input in advance and reduce the attack intensity at the input end via denoising or image transformation，among others. Despite showing a certain anti-attack ability，this method is not only limited by the attack intensity but also faces the problem of over-correcting the normal input data. The former limitation hinders this method from dealing with slight disturbances that human beings cannot perceive，while the latter problem exposes this method to the risk of making wrong judgments on normal data，thereby reducing its classification accuracy. Directly-enhancing-network-based methods directly improve the anti-attack capability of the network by adding subnetworks and by changing the loss function，activation function，batch normalization layer，or network training process. Adversarial-training-based methods are typical heuristic defense methods compared with the other two. These methods inject the adversary attack and adversary defense into a framework，wherein adversarial examples are initially generated by attacking the existing models. Afterward，these adversarial examples are used to train the target model to produce an accurate output for these examples and enhance its robustness. Therefore，this paper primarily focuses on adversarial training. Apart from showing certain ability to defend against attacks，adversarial training also improves the robustness of the model at the cost of reducing its classification or recognition accuracy for normal data. Many researchers find that the more robust the model is，the lower is its classification or recognition accuracy for normal examples. In addition，the defense effect of the current adversarial training remains unsatisfactory for strong adversarial attacks with diversified attack modes. To address this issue，recent studies have improved the standard adversarial training from different perspectives. For instance，some studies have generated adversarial examples with high diversity or portability in the attack stage. To enhance model robustness，many scholars have combined adversarial training with network enhancement to resist an adversarial attack. This process involves network structure modification，model parameters adjustment，and adversarial training acceleration，which help the model resist different types of attacks. The standard adversarial training only considers the classification of adversarial examples in the defense stage and ignores the classification accuracy for the original examples. In this connection，many works not only introduce the spatial or semantic consistency constraints between the original and adversarial examples but also require the model to produce an accurate output with respect to the latter，thus ensuring that the model considers both robustness and accuracy. To enhance the transferability of the model，curriculum learning，reinforcement learning，metric learning，and domain adaptation technologies are integrated into adversarial training. This paper then comprehensively reviews adversarial training technologies. First，the basic framework of adversarial training is elaborated. Second，typical methods and critical technologies for the generation of adversarial samples are reviewed. We summarize the adversarial examples generation methods based on image space，feature space，and physical space attacks. To improve the diversity of adversarial examples，we also introduce interpolation- and reinforcement-learning-related adversarial example generation strategies. Given that standard adversarial training is extremely time consuming，we briefly describe optimization strategies based on temporal，spatial，and spatiotemporal mixed momentum，which are conducive to improving training efficiency. Defense is the fundamental problem of adversarial training that is devoted to absorbing the generated adversarial examples for training via loss minimization. Therefore，we briefly review the technologies typically used in the defensive training stage，including the loss regularization term，model enhancement mechanism，parameter adaptation，early stop，and semi-supervised or unsupervised expansion strategies. To evaluate the robustness of the model，we summarize the popular datasets and typical attack methods. After sorting out relevant adversarial training technologies，we still face challenges in dealing with multi-disturbance integrated attacks and the low efficiency of the model. We put forward these problems as directions for future research on adversarial training. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adversarial attack; adversarial defense; adversarial training; deep learning; robustness","","收稿日期：2022-10-27；修回日期：2023-03-15；预印本日期：2023-03-22 *?通信作者：王海鹏 whp5691@163.com 基金项目：国家自然科学基金项目（61601397，62076249）；国防科技基础加强技术领域基金项目（2022-JCJQ-JJ-0287）；山东省自然科学基金 创新发展联合基金项目（ZR202209130044） Supported by：National Natural Science Foundation of China（ 61601397， 62076249） ； National Defense Basic Scientific Research Funds（ 2022-JCJQ-JJ-0287） ； Shandong Natural Science Foundation Innovation and Development Joint Fund Project（ ZR202209130044）","","Beijing University of Technology","02540037","","BGDXD","","Chinese","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182651130"

Bitcoin mechanics allow for users to mask their identity through obfuscation techniques. Much research has been published in the domain of identifying illicit activity in cryptocurrency, and in particular the emergence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has shown great promise in this area. In this paper, we propose two graph preprocessing methods to improve performance and robustness of our node classification GNN models in identifying illicit transactions in the Bitcoin network. Our methods focus on graph restructuring through measuring the connectivity of nodes in a graph, and the similarity of the underlying features each node possesses. We demonstrate the graph restructuring methodologies on five GNN architectures and empirically show an improvement of evaluation metrics when compared against the unprocessed graph dataset. We compare our proposed methods against other imbalanced node classification techniques on a common graph dataset. This methodology has great opportunity in the transaction monitoring landscape for exchanges and financial institutions attempting to capture potential illicit activity taking place on their networks including money laundering. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cryptocurrency; financial cybercrime; fraud detection; graph neural networks; graph preprocessing; transaction monitoring","Bitcoin; Classification (of information); Graph theory; Cyber-crimes; Financial cybercrime; Fraud detection; Graph neural networks; Graph preprocessing; Improve performance; Pre-processing method; Structural learning; Transaction monitoring; Two-graphs","This publication has emanated from research conducted with the financial support of Science Foundation Ireland under Grant number 18/CRT/6183.

However, thus far, a comprehensive and systematic survey of recent literature has been lacking to quantitatively capture the research progress as well as emerging trends in the event prediction field. Aiming at addressing this gap, we employed CiteSpace software to analyze and visualize data retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database, including authors, documents, research institutions, and keywords, based on which the author co-citation network, document co-citation network, collaborative institution network, and keyword co-occurrence network were constructed. Through analyzing the aforementioned networks, we identified areas of active research, influential literature, collaborations at the national level, interdisciplinary patterns, and emerging trends by identifying the central nodes and the nodes with strong citation bursts. It reveals that sensor data has been widely used for predicting weather events and meteorological events (e.g., monitoring sea surface temperature and weather sensor data for predicting El Nino). The real-time and multivariable monitoring features of sensor data enable it to be a reliable source for predicting multiple types of events. Our work offers not only a comprehensive survey of the existing studies but also insights into the development trends within the event prediction field. These findings will assist researchers in conducting further research in this area and draw a large readership among academia and industrial communities who are engaged in event prediction research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CiteSpace; complex network analysis; event prediction; visual analysis","","","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","20763417","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192436726"

Existing works mostly focus on leveraging various spatiotemporal neural networks to model spatiotemporal correlations among dynamic urban features and events, and have achieved promising results. However, it still remains the following problems. First, urban events are naturally induced by multiple causes and distributed spatiotemporal sparsely, while such spatiotemporal sparsity can be induced by the inherent infrequent occurrence and its collection incompleteness. Given that, existing works cannot well address such sparsity challenge and zero-inflated issue in short-term forecasting. Second, the occurred events have the potential to raise future risks on neighboring regions. Unfortunately, off-the-shelf literatures tend to homogenize the correlations of feature-event and event-event, and fail to capture the wane-and-wax influences of historical event sequences on future events. Therefore, to cooperatively exploit the event labels and spatiotemporal features, this paper proposes a teacher-student spatiotemporal semi-supervised learning framework, addressing the challenge of short-term spatiotemporal event forecasting. In the teacher network, to tackle the sparsity challenge of event labels, this paper introduces the semi-supervised scheme into spatiotemporal learning where it designs an AutoEncoder-based feature reconstruction learning and spatiotemporal variance-based anomaly descriptor to facilitate feature representations. In the student network, this work designs a feature-event disentangled dual pipeline and proposes the spatiotemporal attenuation graph convolution network (GCN) and long-short term memory network (LSTM) to imitate the natural risk propagation along spatiotemporal domains. In addition, this paper also develops the spatiotemporal multi-granularity risk prediction task, which emphasizes the easy-to-learn coarse-grained prediction to guide the high-quality fine-grained forecasting, and finally realizes the high-risk discrete region nomination with coarse-to-fine learning mechanism. Experiments on NYC and SIP datasets illustrate that the proposed event forecasting framework outperforms the best baselines by respectively 5.46% and 10.65%, verifying the effectiveness of our work. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","event forecasting; graph neural network; spatiotemporal multi-granularity forecasting; spatiotemporal semi-supervised learning; teacher-student network","Backpropagation; Graph neural networks; Long short-term memory; Semi-supervised learning; Students; Event forecasting; Multi-granularity; Spatiotemporal event; Spatiotemporal multi-granularity forecasting; Spatiotemporal semi-supervised learning; Student network; Teacher-student network; Teachers'; Forecasting","Keywords:　eventforecasting;spatiotemporalmulti-granularityforecasting;graphneuralnetwork;spatiotemporal semi-supervisedlearning;teacher-studentnetwork Foundation Item(s):　National Natural ?cience Foundation of China (No.62072427, No.12227901); The Project of ?table?upportforYouthTeaminBasicResearchField,CA?(No.Y?BR-005)","","Chinese Institute of Electronics","03722112","","TTHPA","","Chinese","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184664181"

Our model can not only effectively distinguish and correlate upstream and downstream traffics, but also clearly embody the relationship between different traffics from the same source node and destination node by the established graph structure. We also improve the model by utilising the characteristics of the existing network attacks, which indicates that the traffic spatiotemporal characteristics could achieve high accuracy on attack traffic detection. Compared to the previous model, extensive experiments show that our proposed model outperforms other similar models in performance. For the multi-classification tasks, our model can effectively detect most of the network attacks and outperform traditional machine learning methods. In terms of model robustness, our model is less affected by adversarial attacks than traditional machine learning models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anti-attack; Intrusion detection; Message passing neural network; Robustness; Traffic spatiotemporal features","Computer crime; Feature extraction; Graphic methods; Intrusion detection; Neural networks; Anti-attack; Intrusion detection models; Intrusion-Detection; Message passing neural network; Message-passing; Model-based OPC; Neural-networks; Robustness; Spatiotemporal feature; Traffic spatiotemporal feature; Message passing","Funding text 1: 3.

These platforms contain various content such as violence, explicit content, drug use and smoking that may be offensive or harmful to certain viewers. As a result, censorship is employed to filter or remove content that is unsuitable for particular audiences such as children and teenagers. However, policies for censoring harmful content in digital environments are either limited or nonexistent. This underscores the need for automated systems that can detect and censor harmful content in real time. To address these challenges, we developed the first of our knowledge systems using deep learning techniques to censor harmful content. We propose two novel, YOLO-based real-time censorship algorithms. Our approaches employ a pipeline-based architecture that parallelizes the operations with subprocesses. In our experiments, the proposed algorithms performed faster and with higher accuracies compared to traditional approaches. Specifically, its content-based accuracies were 98% for explicit content, 97% for alcohol, 98% for cigarettes and 97% for violence. Our research highlights the importance of developing effective and efficient solutions for censoring harmful content on digital media platforms. Our deep learning-based system represents a promising approach to this challenge and has the potential to enhance user safety and protect vulnerable groups from harmful and offensive content. Future research will continue to refine and improve such systems to better address the evolving landscape of digital media and the challenges posed by harmful content. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","content censorship; deep learning; image analysis; object classification; object detection; object tracking; video analysis","Automation; Deep learning; Digital storage; Image classification; Learning systems; Real time systems; Tracking (position); Video on demand; Content censorship; Image-analysis; Object classification; Object Tracking; Objects detection; Real time images; Real- time; Real-time images; Video analysis; Object detection","","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","02664720; 14680394","0896710742","EXSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169106684"

However, supervised learning requires training datasets which are not always available or easy to construct with aerial imagery. In this respect, unsupervised machine learning techniques present important advantages. This work presents a novel pipeline to demonstrate how available aerial imagery can be used to better the provision of services related to the built environment, using the case study of road traffic collisions (RTCs) across three cities in the UK. In this paper, we show how aerial imagery can be leveraged to extract latent features of the built environment from the purely visual representation of top-down images. With these latent image features in hand to represent the urban structure, this work then demonstrates how hazardous road segments can be clustered to provide a data-augmented aid for road safety experts to enhance their nuanced understanding of how and where different types of RTCs occur. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","article; built environment; city; feature extraction; human; human experiment; imagery; pipeline; road safety; traffic","This work was supported by Towards Turing 2.0 under the EPSRC Grant EP/W037211/1 & The Alan Turing Institute.","","Nature Research","20452322","","","37407750","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163973964"

As well known, money laundering (ML) is critical to the effective operation of transnational and organized crime, which affects a country's economy, government, and social wellbeings. Financial services organizations facilitate the movement of money and have been enlisted by governments to assist with the detection and prevention of money laundering, which is a key tool in the fight to reduce crime and create sustainable economic development. In the application of AML, user identity and financial behavior data are widely used to detect laundering transactions. In recent years, an increasing number of money laundering activities have been conducted by organized criminal gangs while most existing works still treat the actions of each account as independent identity behavior without considering the group-level conspired interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a group-aware deep graph learning-based approach for organized money-laundering detection. In particular, we design a community-centric encoder to represent the nodes and attributes in user transaction graphs and derive the adjacent gang behaviors. Then, we devise a scheme of local enhancement to accommodate nodes with similar transaction features, which are aggregated into gangs for downstream detection. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset from one of the largest bank card alliances worldwide show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both offline and online modes, showing the effectiveness of money laundering detection with group-aware deep graph learning. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","data mining; graph learning; graph neural network; Money laundering","Behavioral research; Deep learning; Economics; Anti-money laundering; Behavioral science; Biological system modeling; Data mining problems; Graph learning; Graph neural networks; Image edge detection; Optimisations; Task analysis; Transnational crimes; Data mining","","","IEEE Computer Society","10414347","","ITKEE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159832056"

In this article, we introduce CovidTrak, a vision of social intelligence-empowered contact tracing that aims to scrutinize the knowledge derived using social sensing to track Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections among the general public. Contact tracing is known to be an effective technique for detecting and monitoring persons who may have been exposed to individuals infected with any communicable disease. While a good number of contact tracing schemes are existent today (e.g., in-person and phone interviews, paper forms, email and web-based questionnaires, and smartphone apps), they often require active user participation and might miss certain cases of social interactions that go off-the-records but still lead to COVID-19 transmission. By contrast, social sensing provides an alternative avenue for spontaneously determining such contacts by harnessing the rich experiences and information conveyed by people on social data platforms (e.g., a group photograph tweeted from a house party with a potential contact). As such, CovidTrak can form a powerful basis to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The vision of CovidTrak intends to answer the following questions: 1) how to bolster the privacy and security of the online users while determining their contacts? 2) how to collect relevant social signals that indicate in-person encounters among people? 3) how to reliably process the vast amount of noisy data from social platforms to identify chains of transmission? 4) how to handle the scarcity of location metadata in the incoming data? 5) how to effectively communicate crucial contact information to concerned individuals? and 6) how to model and handle the responses of the common people toward contact information? We envision unexplored opportunities to leverage multidisciplinary techniques to address the above questions and develop effective future CovidTrak schemes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contact tracing; Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19); crowdsensing; knowledge discovery; public awareness; social sensing","Blogs; Data mining; Social networking (online); Surveys; Contact tracing; Coronavirus disease 2019; Crowdsensing; Internet connectivity; Pandemic; Public awareness; Smart devices; Social intelligence; Social sensing; COVID-19","This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant IIS-2202481, Grant CHE-2105005, Grant IIS-2008228, Grant CNS-1845639, and Grant CNS-1831669.","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2329924X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136722822"

Thus it is critically important to accurately forecast the traffic accident risks of different areas in a city, which has attracted increasing research interest in the research area of urban computing. The challenges of accurate traffic risk forecasting are three-fold. First, traffic accident data in some areas of a city is sparse, especially for a fine-grained prediction, which may cause the zero inflation problem during model training. Second, the spatio-temporal correlations of the traffic accidents occurring in different areas are rather complex and non-linear, which is difficult to capture by existing shallow models like regression. Third, the occurrence of traffic accidents can be significantly affected by various context features including weather, POI and road network features. It is non-trivial to capture the complex associations between the diverse context features and traffic accident risks for building an accurate prediction model. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a Multi-View Multi-Task Spatio-Temporal Networks (MVMT-STN) model to forecast fine- and coarse-grained traffic accident risks of a city simultaneously. Specifically, to address the data sparsity issue in a fine-grained prediction, we adopt a multi-task learning framework to jointly forecast both fine- and coarse-grained traffic accident risks by considering their spatial associations. For each granularity prediction, we design the channel-wise CNN and multi-view GCN to capture the local geographic dependency and global semantic dependency, respectively. In order to obtain the diverse impacts of the context features on traffic accidents, we also introduce a fusion learning module that integrates the channel-wise and multi-view features learned from different types of the external factors. We conduct extensive experiments over two large real traffic accident datasets. The results show that MVMT-STN improves the performance of traffic accident risk prediction in both fine- and coarse-grained prediction by a large margin compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","graph neural networks; multi-task learning; spatio-temporal data; Traffic accident forecasting","Graph neural networks; Health risks; Highway accidents; Large dataset; Learning systems; Accident risks; Correlation; Multitask learning; Predictive models; Representation learning; Road; Spatio-temporal data; Traffic accident forecasting; Urban areas; Forecasting","","","IEEE Computer Society","10414347","","ITKEE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121818439"

Therefore, we propose Busyness Graph Neural Network (BysGNN), a temporal graph neural network designed to learn and uncover the underlying multi-context correlations between POIs for accurate visit forecasting. Unlike other approaches where only time-series data is used to learn a dynamic graph, BysGNN utilizes all contextual information and time-series data to learn an accurate dynamic graph representation.

People move around with smart gadgets and devices in the home, work environment, and familiar places. The Internet acts as a backbone for all applications and connecting multiple devices to set up a smart environment is technically termed as IoT (Internet of Things). The feature merits of IoT are explored in numerous fields from simple psychical data measurement to complex trajectory data measurement. Where the place is inaccessible to humans, IoT devices are used to analyze the region. Though IoT provides numerous benefits, due to its size and energy limitations, it faces security and privacy issues. Intrusions in IoT networks have become common due to these limitations and various intrusion detection methods are introduced in the past decade. Existing learning-based methods lag in performance while detecting multiple attacks. Conventional detection models could not be able to detect the intrusion type in detail. The diverse IoT network data has several types of high dimensional features which could not be effectively processed by the conventional methods while detecting intrusions. Recently improvements in learning strategies proved the performance of deep learning models in intrusion detection systems. However, detecting multiple attacks using a single deep learning model is quite complex. Thus, in this research a multi deep learning model is presented to detect multiple attacks. The initial intrusion features are extracted through the AlexNet, and then essential features are selected through bidirectional LSTM. Finally, the selected features are classified using the decision tree C5.0 algorithm to attain better detection accuracy. Proposed model experimentations include benchmark NSL-KDD dataset to verify performances and compared the results with existing IDSs based on DeepNet, Multi-CNN, Auto Encoder, Gaussian mixture, Generative adversarial Network, and Convolutional Neural Network models.

Nowadays, many people use navigation apps such as Google Maps, Waze, and Flitsmeister to obtain real-time travel information and provide feedback on road conditions, such as reporting police speed checks. As an accurate traffic speed prediction is of great significance for road users and traffic managers, different models have been proposed and widely used to predict traffic speed considering the spatio-temporal dependence of traffic data and external factors such as the weather, accidents and points of interest. This study investigates the impact of crowdsourced data about police enforcement from navigation apps on traffic speed. In addition, we examine whether the police enforcement report affects the accuracy of the deep learning prediction model. The authors extract crowdsourced police enforcement information from navigation apps, collect the corresponding historical traffic speed data, and predict traffic speed in several corridors in The Netherlands using a GCN-GRU traffic speed prediction model. The results show that the crowdsourced data for police enforcement cause the average vehicle speed to drop between 1 [km/h] and 3 [km/h] when passing the road segments marked with police activity. Moreover, the prediction performance of the GCN-GRU model during the periods without police enforcement is better than the periods with reported police activity, showing that police speed check reports can decrease the accuracy of speed prediction models. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","crowdsourced data; police enforcement; traffic enforcement; traffic speed prediction","","","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192360198"

Extremely overcrowded regions such as subways, public streets, banks, and the industries need such automatic VD system to ensure safety and security in the smart city.

To deeply examine and contribute to the VD arena, we survey and analyze the VD literature into a single platform that highlights the working flow of VD in terms of machine learning strategies, neural networks (NNs)-based patterns analysis, limitations in existing VD articles, and their source details. Further, we investigate VD in terms of surveillance datasets and VD applications and debate on the challenges faced by researchers using these datasets.

Deep learning-based cyber attack detection methods have rapidly developed with powerful feature representation and extraction capabilities. However, deep learning-based cyber attack detection models built in traditional Euclidean space cannot effectively capture the complex topology in the attack graphs. In order to efficiently model the potential patterns in the cyber attack graph and thus improve the detection accuracy, a cyber attack detection model built in dual curvatured Riemannian spaces with mutual learning (namely RSML) is proposed. Unlike existing methods, RSML migrates the cyber attack detection model in the traditional Euclidean space to a heterogeneous non-Euclidean learning space and uses the large-scale hierarchical and circular graph structure pattern modeling capabilities possessed by the non-Euclidean curvatured Riemannian geometry space to obtain high-quality attack graph representation vectors, thereby improves the cyber attack detection accuracy. Besides, we innovatively introduce the mutual learning to enable mutual knowledge distillation from dual Riemannian spaces and thus promotes the fusion of complex topological structure features in different embedding spaces. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively analyze and detect cyber attacks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyber security; Deep learning; Mutual learning; Riemannian space","Computer crime; Cyber attacks; Deep learning; Distillation; Geometry; Network security; Topology; Vector spaces; Attack detection; Attack graph; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Detection accuracy; Detection models; Euclidean spaces; Mutual learning; Riemannian spaces; Crime","This work is supported by the Science and Technology Project of State Grid Shandong Electric Power Company: ""Research on Key","","Association for Computing Machinery","","9798400709111; 9798400709456","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183465325"

In the context of spatio-temporal prediction, the key lies in how to model the dependencies of sensors. However, existing works basically only consider the micro relationships between sensors, where the sensors are treated equally, and their macroscopic dependencies are neglected. In this paper, we argue to rethink the sensor's dependency modeling from two hierarchies: regional and global perspectives. Particularly, we merge original sensors with high intra-region correlation as a region node to preserve the inter-region dependency. Then, we generate representative and common spatio-temporal patterns as global nodes to reflect a global dependency between sensors and provide auxiliary information for spatio-temporal dependency learning. In pursuit of the generality and reality of node representations, we incorporate a Meta GCN to calibrate the regional and global nodes in the physical data space. Furthermore, we devise the cross-hierarchy graph convolution to propagate information from different hierarchies. In a nutshell, we propose a Hierarchical Information Enhanced Spatio-Temporal prediction method, HIEST, to create and utilize the regional dependency and common spatiotemporal patterns. Extensive experiments have verified the leading performance of our HIEST against state-of-the-art baselines.

Considering the demand for its grand application, we recognize key factors for an ideal spatio-temporal prediction method: efficient, lightweight, and effective. However, the current deep model-based spatio-temporal prediction solutions generally own intricate architectures with cumbersome optimization, which can hardly meet these expectations. To accomplish the above goals, we propose an intuitive and novel framework, MLPST, a pure multi-layer perceptron architecture for traffic prediction. Specifically, we first capture spatial relationships from both local and global receptive fields. Then, temporal dependencies in different intervals are comprehensively considered. Through compact and swift MLP processing, MLPST can well capture the spatial and temporal dependencies while requiring only linear computational complexity, as well as model parameters that are more than an order of magnitude lower than baselines. Extensive experiments validated the superior effectiveness and efficiency of MLPST against advanced baselines, and among models with optimal accuracy, MLPST achieves the best time and space efficiency. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","MLP-Mixer; Spatio-Temporal Data Mining; Traffic Prediction","Data mining; Forecasting; Traffic control; Transportation routes; 'current; Data mining tasks; Key factors; MLP-mixer; Model-based OPC; Prediction methods; Public transportation systems; Spatio-temporal data mining; Spatio-temporal prediction; Traffic prediction; Efficiency","Funding text 1: Junbo Zhang is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (62172034), the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (4212021), and the Beijing Nova Program (Z201100006820053).

Many state-of-the-art models demonstrate the strong capability of spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNN) to capture complex spatio-temporal correlations. However, despite their effectiveness, existing approaches do not adequately address several key challenges. Data quality issues, such as data scarcity and sparsity, lead to data noise and a lack of supervised signals, which significantly limit the performance of STGNN. Although recent STGNN models with contrastive learning aim to address these challenges, most of them use pre-defined augmentation strategies that heavily depend on manual design and cannot be customized for different Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new spatio-temporal contrastive learning (CL4ST) framework to encode robust and generalizable STG representations via the STG augmentation paradigm. Specifically, we design the meta view generator to automatically construct node and edge augmentation views for each disentangled spatial and temporal graph in a data-driven manner. The meta view generator employs meta networks with parameterized generative model to customize the augmentations for each input. This personalizes the augmentation strategies for every STG and endows the learning framework with spatio-temporal-aware information. Additionally, we integrate a unified spatio-temporal graph attention network with the proposed meta view generator and two-branch graph contrastive learning paradigms.

Considering the various fields demanding attention, e.g., traffic state, human activity, and social event, predicting multiple spatio-temporal attributes simultaneously can alleviate regulatory pressure and foster smart city construction. However, current research can not handle the spatio-temporal multi-attribute prediction well due to the complex relationships between diverse attributes. The key challenge lies in how to address the common spatio-temporal patterns while tackling their distinctions. In this paper, we propose an effective solution for spatio-temporal multi-attribute prediction, PromptST. We devise a spatio-temporal transformer and a parameter-sharing training scheme to address the common knowledge among different spatiotemporal attributes. Then, we elaborate a spatio-temporal prompt tuning strategy to fit the specific attributes in a lightweight manner. Through the pretrain and prompt tuning phases, our PromptST is able to enhance the specific spatio-temoral characteristic capture by prompting the backbone model to fit the specific target attribute while maintaining the learned common knowledge. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets verify that our PromptST attains state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we also prove PromptST owns good transferability on unseen spatio-temporal attributes, which brings promising application potential in urban computing.

However, the black-box nature of STGNNs limits their interpretability, hindering their application in scenarios related to urban resource allocation and policy formulation. To bridge this gap, we propose an Explainable Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STExplainer) framework that enhances STGNNs with inherent explainability, enabling them to provide accurate predictions and faithful explanations simultaneously. Our framework integrates a unified spatio-temporal graph attention network with a positional information fusion layer as the STG encoder and decoder, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a structure distillation approach based on the Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB) principle with an explainable objective, which is instantiated by the STG encoder and decoder. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our STExplainer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of predictive accuracy and explainability metrics (i.e., sparsity and fidelity) on traffic and crime prediction tasks. Furthermore, our model exhibits superior representation ability in alleviating data missing and sparsity issues.

In the era of big data, how to dynamically optimize the deployment of limited police forces and successfully improve the effectiveness of crime prevention based on data-driven crime predictions is a research focus in the field of global predictive policing. It is also a main practical direction for law enforcement agencies worldwide to implement modern proactive policing models. Traditional crime geography and spatiotemporal crime prediction methods mainly use police precincts or grids as the basic spatial analysis unit, and the analysis results are not conducive to guiding refined patrol force planning and deployment. The graph neural network based on deep learning can be combined with the topological structure of the road network at the micro scale, enabling precise crime prediction at the street scale. However, existing approaches rarely consider the impact of road weights in model prediction. In this paper, a Road Weighted Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (RW-STGCN) is constructed for street crime prediction by introducing road network accessibility and distance attenuation factors, and the model is evaluated using street theft crime data of Chicago. The results show that: (1) Compared to the spatiotemporal graph convolutional networks without considering road weights, the hit rate of the RW-STGCN increases by more than 6.5% across various road network coverage ratios (1%, 5%, 10%, and 20%), and the increase becomes more significant as the coverage ratio decreases, with a maximum increase exceeding 50%. This indicates the effectiveness and superiority of the RW-STGCN for smaller units; (2) Model ablation experiments show that the hit rate of the RW-STGCN considering road weights increases by 13.5% compared to the model result without considering road weights, and the model considering both road weights has a more significant improvement in prediction performance than the model considering only a single factor of distance attenuation weight or road network access weight, with a maximum increase of 12.9% in hit rate. This suggests that deep learning methods combined with geographic features can effectively improve the accuracy of crime prediction. The RW-STGCN is helpful for street crime prediction and can provide auxiliary decision support for law enforcement agencies to conduct scientific patrol planning and police force deployment based on road networks. In addition, it is also useful for the study of road-related urban computing problems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","crime prediction; graph convolutional network; predictive policing; road weights; spatial syntax; spatialtemporal prediction; street crime","Big data; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crime; Deep learning; Forecasting; Geographic information systems; Learning systems; Risk assessment; Topology; Convolutional networks; Crime prediction; Graph convolutional network; Predictive policing; Road weight; Spatial syntax; Spatial temporals; Spatialtemporal prediction; Spatio-temporal graphs; Street crime; Roads and streets; artificial neural network; crime; geostatistics; GIS; law enforcement; machine learning; police force; prediction; road; spatiotemporal analysis; Chicago; Illinois; United States","Funding text 1: 国家重点研发计划项目 （ 2022 YFB3903602 ） ； 公安部科技强警基础工作专项 （ 2021 JC35 ） ； 国家自然科学基金青年 项目 （ 42001 159 ） ； 国家自然科学基金项目 （ 41971367 ） 。[ Foundation items: National Key Research and Develop-mentProgram,No.2022YFB3903602;SpecialProjectsofMinistryofPublicSecurityinStrengtheningBasicPolice W ork, No.2021JC35;Y outh FundoftheNationalNaturalScienceFoundationofChina,No.42001 159 ;NationalNatu-ralScienceFoundationofChina,No.41971367.] 贺日兴 （ 1972 —） ， 男， 江西安福人， 博士， 教授， 博导， 主要从事犯罪地理和警用地理信息技术等研究。 E-mail:herixing@cnu.edu.cn ： 邓 悦 （ 1994 —） ， 女， 新疆哈巴河人， 博士， 讲师， 主要研究方向为空间数据挖掘、 空间分析。 E-mail:6921@cnu.edu.cn; Funding text 2: National Key Research and Development Program, No.2022YFB3903602; Special Projects of Ministry of Public Security in Strengthening Basic Police Work, No.2021JC35; Youth Fund of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, No.42001159; National Natural Science Foundation of China, No.41971367.]","","Science Press","15608999","","","","Chinese","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172177985"

Due to the delay of network transmission and failure of detectors, massive missing traffic data are often produced in ITSs, which evidently decreases the accuracy of decision-making in road traffic management. Hence, how establishing a precise and efficient estimation of missing traffic data becomes a hot yet thorny issue. Low-rank matrix completion (LR-MC) model has proven to be highly effective to address this issue owing to its fine representativeness of such high-dimensional and incomplete data. However, the existing LR-MC models mostly fail to model the inherently temporal and spatial correlations hidden in traffic network structure, resulting in low estimation accuracy. To improve it, this paper proposes a Hessian regularization spatio-temporal low rank (HRST-LR) algorithm with three main-fold ideas: a) imposing low-rank property into the global features of a traffic matrix for precisely learning its structure, b) capturing the temporal evolvement via a second-order difference of time-series constraint, and c) modeling the similar space of road segments through a Hessian regularization spatial constraint, thus exploring the local correlation between road segments for representing the spatial patterns in the traffic data. Experimental results on four traffic data sets prove that HRST-LR outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in the missing traffic data estimation with the root mean squared error improvements often higher than 14% when the missing rate is 90%. Hence, the HRST-LR algorithm is highly valuable for traffic data imputation with the need of performing spatio-temporal low-rank analysis. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hessian regularization; Matrix completion; missing traffic data imputation; spatio-temporal constraints","Decision making; Highway administration; Highway planning; Intelligent systems; Matrix algebra; Mean square error; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Time series analysis; Data imputation; Hessian regularization; Matrix completion; Minimisation; Missing traffic data imputation; Regularisation; Road; Sparse matrices; Spatio-temporal constraints; Time-series analysis; Traffic data; Traffic congestion","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61872086, Grant 62272103, and Grant 62272078; in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China under Grant 2022J06020; and in part by the Young Top Talent of Young Eagle Program of Fujian Province, China, under Grant F21E0011202B01.","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15580016; 15249050","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162724384"

As the precondition in smart parking, accurate parking prediction can reduce the time drivers spend searching for parking spaces and relieve traffic congestion. Meanwhile, VANET and the Internet-of-things (IoT) are the key elements of the current intelligent transportation system. With the IoT devices based on VANET becoming more extensively employed, a large amount of parking data is generated every day, and various methods are proposed for parking prediction, therefore, it is time to systematically summarize the parking prediction issues and the state-of-the-art prediction methods. In this survey, we first provide a comprehensive review of the existing methods used for parking prediction ranging from conventional statistical methods to the latest graph neural network methods. Then, we classify a variety of parking problems such as parking availability prediction, parking behavior prediction, and parking demand prediction. We also compile all the evaluation metrics, open data, and open-source code of the surveyed literature. Finally, we present the challenges and future directions of the parking prediction technique.

These two types of data may not fully cover a city. Inferring from one type of data to another will enrich our means of sensing cities and facilitate a deeper understanding of the place. Intuitively, by analyzing visual elements of the urban built environment such as buildings, roads, vehicles, and other features captured in photos of their surroundings, we can infer valuable information about the most likely POI types. Traditional approaches are mainly based on probabilistic statistical models. Such models lack a holistic understanding of the scenario and accurate modeling of the non-linear relationship between the built and socio-economic environments. In response, a Seq2Seq framework is proposed to “translate” and create a bridge between those two data.

With the ubiquitous use of social media and the prosperous developments in machine and deep learning, it has become feasible to collect and process massive amounts of information produced by online communities about their perceptions of heritage as social constructs. Moreover, such information is usually inter-connected and embedded within specific socioeconomic and spatiotemporal contexts. This paper presents a methodological workflow for using semi-supervised learning with graph neural networks (GNN) to classify, summarize, and map cultural significance categories based on user-generated content on social media. Several GNN models were trained as an ensemble to incorporate the multi-modal (visual and textual) features and the contextual (temporal, spatial, and social) connections of social media data in an attributed multi-graph structure. The classification results with different models were aligned and evaluated with the prediction confidence and agreement. Furthermore, message diffusion methods on graphs were proposed to aggregate the post labels onto their adjacent spatial nodes, which helps to map the cultural significance categories in their geographical contexts. The workflow is tested on data gathered from Venice as a case study, demonstrating the generation of social perception maps for this UNESCO World Heritage property. This research framework could also be applied in other cities worldwide, contributing to more socially inclusive heritage management processes. Furthermore, the proposed methodology holds the potential of diffusing any human-generated location-based information onto spatial networks and temporal timelines, which could be beneficial for measuring the safety, vitality, and/or popularity of urban spaces. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Graph Neural Networks; Heritage values and attributes; Label diffusion; Multi-modal machine learning; Social media data; Spectral centrality","Graph neural networks; Learning systems; Photomapping; Social networking (online); Urban planning; Heritage value and attribute; Heritage values; Label diffusion; Machine-learning; Multi-modal; Multi-modal machine learning; Social media datum; Social perception; Spectral centrality; Deep learning; artificial neural network; cultural heritage; culture; detection method; machine learning; mapping method; perception; social media; spectral analysis; supervised classification; UNESCO; Italy; Veneto; Venezia [Veneto]; Venice","Funding text 1: The presented study is within the framework of the Heriland-Consortium.

Once a crime is committed, focusing on linking it to previously reported crimes and reducing the inspections based on shreds of evidence and the behavior of offenders can also greatly help law enforcement agencies. However, classical investigative techniques are generally case-specific and rely mainly on police officers manually combining information from different sources. Therefore, automatic methods designed to support co-offender research and crime linkage would be beneficial. This paper proposes two graph-based machine learning frameworks to address these issues based on a burglary use case, the first being transductive link prediction, which seeks to predict emergent links between existing graph nodes (which represent offenders or criminal cases), and the other being inductive link prediction, where connections are found between a new case and existing nodes. Our experimental results show a prediction accuracy of 68.5% in co-offender prediction, a 75.83% predictive accuracy for transductive crime linkage, and up to 74.8% accuracy in inductive crime linkage. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Co-offender prediction; Crime linkage; Deep neural networks; Inductive link prediction; Machine learning; Repeat offenders; Transductive link prediction","Crime; Deep neural networks; Graphic methods; Learning systems; Co-offender prediction; Crime linkage; Criminal networks; Inductive link; Inductive link prediction; Link prediction; Machine-learning; Repeat offender; Transductive link prediction; Forecasting","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 833635 (project ROXANNE: Real-time network, text, and speaker analytics for combating organized crime, 2019-2022).; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 833635 (project ROXANNE: Real-time network, text, and speaker analytics for combating organized crime, 2019-2022).","","Elsevier B.V.","18777503","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163757057"

This paper aims to extend the current trends and knowledge with multiple contributions in handwriting classification using spatiotemporal information. Firstly, it enriches the annotations of several publicly available online handwriting datasets, SenseThePen, IAM-onDB, and IAMonDo, for online handwriting classification and recognition tasks. The said datasets are updated with three distinguished levels of annotations, i.e., stroke, sequence, and line levels. The enriched annotations of these datasets extend their functionality for online handwriting classification at different levels for further research analysis. In addition to enrichment, it also unifies the annotation levels across the datasets, which enables the research community to benchmark proposed methods for comparative analysis using multiple datasets. All the datasets with enriched annotations are made publicly available for the research community as part of the IAMonSense dataset. Moreover, this paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of these datasets using multiple deep neural networks such as traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), graph convolutional networks(GCNs), attention-based neural networks, and transformers. These benchmarks can be used later on for further development in online handwriting classification. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep learning; Graph neural networks; Handwriting classification; Handwriting datasets; Spatiotemporal information; Transformers","Character recognition; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Graph neural networks; Information use; Online systems; Deep learning; Handwriting classification; Handwriting dataset; Multilevels; On-line handwritings; Research communities; Research problems; Spatiotemporal information; Transformer; Classification (of information)","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","14332825; 14332833","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161383186"

Recent studies of visual evaluation focus on either objective or subjective approach, while describing the visual character holistically and monitor its evolution remains challenging. This study introduces an embedding-driven clustering approach that integrates both physical and perceptual attributes to infer the spatial structure of the visual environment, and investigates its spatio-temporal evolution. Singapore, a highly urbanised yet green city, is selected as a case study. Firstly, a visual feature matrix is derived from street view imagery (SVI). Then, a graph neural network is constructed based on road connections to encode visual features and spatial dependency leading to a clustering algorithm that is used to discover the underlying characteristics of the visual environment. The implementation characterises streetscapes of the city-state into six types of clusters. Finally, taking advantage of historical SVI, a longitudinal analysis reveals how visual clusters have evolved in the past decade. Among them, one of the clusters represents high-density visual experience, affirming the work as such streetscape dominates the central business district and it is evolving elsewhere, mirroring the expansion of new towns. In turn, another identified cluster, indicating sparse landscapes, decreased, while areas that are considered to be in the most visually pleasant cluster, increased. For the first time, this study demonstrates a novel method to understand the urban visual structure and analyse its spatio-temporal evolution, which could support future planning decision-making and urban landscape betterment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Change detection; Computer vision; GraphSAGE; Street-level; Urban pattern; Urban perception","algorithm; central business district; dependency; landscape; landscape planning; road construction; satellite imagery; urban planning; Singapore","We thank the members of the NUS Urban Analytics Lab for the discussions, and the editor and the reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions.

Recently, a few enhanced GNN architectures have been developed to tackle heterophily graphs where connected nodes are dissimilar. However, urban graphs usually can be observed to possess a unique spatial heterophily property; that is, the dissimilarity of neighbors at different spatial distances can exhibit great diversity. This property has not been explored, while it often exists. To this end, in this paper, we propose a metric, named Spatial Diversity Score, to quantitatively measure the spatial heterophily and show how it can influence the performance of GNNs. Indeed, our experimental investigation clearly shows that existing heterophilic GNNs are still deficient in handling the urban graph with high spatial diversity score. This, in turn, may degrade their effectiveness in urban applications. Along this line, we propose a Spatial Heterophily Aware Graph Neural Network (SHGNN), to tackle the spatial diversity of heterophily of urban graphs. Based on the key observation that spatially close neighbors on the urban graph present a more similar mode of difference to the central node, we first design a rotation-scaling spatial aggregation module, whose core idea is to properly group the spatially close neighbors and separately process each group with less diversity inside.

The utilization of spatial–temporal information has led to a considerable improvement in service recommendation in the MIoT-enabled service platform. In practical scenarios, the interaction between the user and the service is often initiated by the joint effect of previous service invocations. Many-to-many and high-order spatial–temporal relations exist among services, which are inadequately reflected by prevailing methods that rely on ordinary graphs and consider spatial–temporal relations among services as pairwise connections. Additionally, most methods indiscriminately conflate the separate influences of spatial and temporal information on user preferences, which can lead to suboptimal service recommendation performance. To this end, we propose an approach powered by spatial–temporal hypergraphs (STH) for personalized service recommendation in the MIoT-enabled service platform, which is inspired by the deep learning paradigm. Specifically, we first construct spatial and temporal hypergraphs based on spatial–temporal information. Then, we develop the spatial–temporal hypergraph neural network-based encoders to learn spatial and temporal representations of services. Finally, we introduce an auxiliary task to differentiate between distinct spatial–temporal effects for improved service recommendations. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of STH. Thus, STH not only enhances the user experience but also improves service management in the MIoT-enabled service platform. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hypergraph; Mobile Internet of Things; Service recommendation; Spatial–temporal","Deep learning; Graph theory; Location based services; Telecommunication services; Web services; Hyper graph; Internet of Things enabled Services; Location-based services; Mobile Internet; Mobile internet of thing; Service platforms; Service recommendations; Spatial temporals; Temporal information; Temporal relation; Internet of things","This research has been partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62173199 ).

However, it is well known that the NIDS performance depends heavily on the effectiveness of the detection model, which can be influenced significantly by the learning mechanism and the available training data. Many existing studies try to mitigate the above challenges, but few of them consider the adaptability and the cost of deploying an NIDS, the integrity of the learning process, the capacity of model based on concrete traffic samples at the same time. To fill this gap and improve the detection performance, we propose a collaborative learning-based detection framework called ADCL, which can mitigate the limitations on the knowledge of a single model by leveraging multiple models trained in similar environments and detecting intrusions in a collaborative manner. Our evaluation results indicate that ADCL can provide better performance compared with a single model on detecting various attacks in IoT networks. Specifically, ADCL improves F-score by up to 80% for adaptability, 42% in mitigating the reliance on learning integrity, 85% for model capacity. Furthermore, the detection results of ADCL guide those single models to update and increase the F-score by 15%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Collaborative learning; Internet of Things (IoT); intrusion detection; multiple model; system adaptability","Computer crime; Internet of things; Knowledge management; Network security; Support vector machines; Adaptation models; Adaptive networks; Collaborative learning; F-score; Intrusion-Detection; Multiple-modeling; Network intrusion detection systems; Single models; Support vectors machine; System adaptability; Intrusion detection","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2021YFB2700500 and Grant 2021YFB2700502; in part by the Open Fund of Key Laboratory of Civil Aviation Smart Airport Theory and System, Civil Aviation University of China under Grant SATS202206; in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant U20B2050; and in part by the Public Service Platform for Basic Software and Hardware Supply Chain Guarantee under Grant TC210804A.","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","23274662","9781728176055","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149367998"

Forecasting crime efficiently and accurately is of great significance for improving urban management and public safety. At present, it is difficult for most of the existing studies to obtain accurate crime prediction, because they usually utilize a single machine learning or deep learning model, ignoring the spatiotemporal dependence of the crime. In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal prediction model GAERNN based on deep learning techniques. Firstly, the GAE model is used to capture the spatial distribution characteristics of crime cases. Secondly, the features with spatial dependencies are input into the GRU model after serialization to further extract the temporal features of crime sequences. Then, the spatial and temporal prediction results of theft crime are obtained by the fully connected layer processing. Finally, we select MLP and GCN to carry out contrastive experiments by using several indicators, such as RMSE and MSE, to verify the performance of our model. The results show that our model is significantly superior to other benchmark models in spatiotemporal prediction, and it can be used to prevent and control theft crime effectively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","deep learning; gated cyclic unit; graph neural network; graph self-encoder; Lanzhou; spatiotemporal distribution prediction; theft; urban crime","Crime; Deep learning; Graph neural networks; Learning systems; Network coding; Spatial distribution; Gated cyclic unit; Graph self-encoder; Lanzhou; Spatio-temporal prediction; Spatiotemporal distribution prediction; Spatiotemporal distributions; Theft; Urban crime; Forecasting; artificial neural network; crime; prediction; safety; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; China; Gansu","National Natural Science Foundation of China, No.42061060）；LZJTU EP No.201806；Tianyou innovation team of Lanzhou Jiaotong University, No.TY202001）.","","Science Press","15608999","","","","Chinese","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169603460"

A unified framework was proposed. A classifier was learned to identify different evolutionary genes of segments, and an adversarial generator was adopted to estimate the distribution of segments for evolutionary genes. The model consists of three main components: gene identification which aims at learning the corresponding genes of segments; gene generation which aims at learning to generate segments from genes; gene application which aims at modeling behavioral evolution and applying the learned genes to predict future values and events. The experiments of this study were based on one synthetic dataset and five real datasets. Results demonstrate that the method not only achieves good prediction results, but also provides effective explanations for the results. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adversarial generator; evolutionary gene; generation model; representation learning; time series","Behavioral research; Learning systems; Time series; Adversarial generator; Evolutionary gene; Feature representation; Generation model; Genes identification; Representation learning; Representation model; Times series; Unified framework; User behaviors; Genes","","","Zhejiang University","1008973X","","CHHPD","","Chinese","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166395657"

However, in the vast majority of existing works, the focus is mainly on modeling spatiotemporal correlations in static traffic networks. Thus, the continuous expansion and evolution of traffic networks are ignored. In this work, we study the problem of traffic prediction with expanding road network structures under the continual learning paradigm. Considering the model prediction performance, efficiency, and data accessibility, a SpatioTemporal Knowledge Expansion and Consolidation (STKEC) framework is proposed. This framework contains an influence-based knowledge expansion strategy to help the spatiotemporal learning model integrate new spatiotemporal traffic patterns and a memory-augmented knowledge consolidation mechanism to preserve the learned spatiotemporal patterns without accessing the data in previous graphs. Extensive experiments are conducted on a large-scale dataset and verify the superior performance of STKEC in continual traffic prediction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","continuous learning; expanding road networks; public transportation; Spatiotemporal data mining; traffic prediction","Data mining; Expansion; Large dataset; Learning systems; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Continuous learning; Expanding road network; Intelligent transport; Knowledge expansion; Public transportation; Road network; Spatio-temporal data mining; Traffic networks; Traffic prediction; Transport applications; Forecasting","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15580016; 15249050","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153379106"

Humans collect these multi-source data in chronological order, called multi-view sequential data (MvSD). MvSD has numerous potential application domains, including intelligent transportation, climate science, health care, public safety and multimedia, etc. However, as the volume and scale of MvSD increases, the traditional machine learning methods become difficult to withstand such large-scale data, and it is no longer appropriate to use hand-craft features to represent these complex data. In addition, there is no general framework in the process of mining multi-view relationships and integrating multi-view information. In this paper, We first introduce four common data types that constitute MvSD, including point data, sequence data, graph data, and raster data. Then, we summarize the technical challenges of MvSD. Subsequently, we review the recent progress in deep learning technology applied to MvSD. Meanwhile, we discuss how the network represents and learns features of MvSD. Finally, we summarize the applications of MvSD in different domains and give potential research directions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep neural networks; Multi-view; Sequential data; Spatio-temporal","Learning systems; Applications domains; Chronological order; Industrial societies; Interaction activities; Large amounts; Multi-views; Multisource data; Sensors data; Sequential data; Spatio-temporal; Deep neural networks","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.6197624) and Sichuan Science and Technology Program (No.2021YFG0312).; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.61976247) and Sichuan Science and Technology Program (No.2021YFG0312).","","Springer Nature","15737462; 02692821","","AIRVE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143288427"

Jointly modeling multiple spatio-temporal tasks can further promote an intelligent city life by integrating their inseparable relationship. However, existing studies fail to address this joint learning problem well, which generally solve tasks individually or a fixed task combination. The challenges lie in the tangled relation between different properties, the demand for supporting flexible combinations of tasks and the complex spatio-temporal dependency. To cope with the problems above, we propose an Automated Spatio-Temporal multi-task Learning (AutoSTL) method to handle multiple spatio-temporal tasks jointly. Firstly, we propose a scalable architecture consisting of advanced spatio-temporal operations to exploit the complicated dependency. Shared modules and feature fusion mechanism are incorporated to further capture the intrinsic relationship between tasks. Furthermore, our model automatically allocates the operations and fusion weight. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verified that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, for the nodes in graph, their ST patterns can vary greatly in difficulties for modeling, owning to the heterogeneous nature of ST data. We argue that unveiling the nodes to the model in a meaningful order, from easy to complex, can provide performance improvements over traditional training procedure. The idea has its root in Curriculum Learning which suggests in the early stage of training models can be sensitive to noise and difficult samples. In this paper, we propose ST-Curriculum Dropout, a novel and easy-to-implement strategy for spatial-temporal graph modeling. Specifically, we evaluate the learning difficulty of each node in high-level feature space and drop those difficult ones out to ensure the model only needs to handle fundamental ST relations at the beginning, before gradually moving to hard ones. Our strategy can be applied to any canonical deep learning architecture without extra trainable parameters, and extensive experiments on a wide range of datasets are conducted to illustrate that, by controlling the difficulty level of ST relations as the training progresses, the model is able to capture better representation of the data and thus yields better generalization. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Deep learning; Graph theory; Learning systems; Taxicabs; Demand prediction; Graph model; Performance; Spatial temporals; Spatial-temporal data; Temporal graphs; Temporal pattern; Temporal relation; Traffic speed; Training procedures; Curricula","We are grateful to anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

Within this context, embeddings are usually (relatively) low-dimensional, distributed representations of various data types (such as texts or graphs), and since they have proven to be extremely useful for a variety of data analysis tasks across various disciplines and fields, they have become widely used. Existing visualization approaches aim to either support exploration and interpretation of the embedding space through visual representation and interaction, or aim to use embeddings as part of the computational pipeline for addressing downstream analytical tasks.

The systems are designed to interact with the physical world, monitor and control the physical processes while in operation, and generate data. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) comprise multiple layers of interconnected neurons that process input data to produce predictions. Spatial-temporal data represents the physical world and its evolution over time and space. The generated spatial-temporal data is used to make decisions and control the behavior of CPS. This paper systematically reviews the applications of DNNs, namely convolutional, recurrent, and graphs, in handling spatial-temporal data in CPS. An extensive literature survey is conducted to determine the areas in which DNNs have successfully captured spatial-temporal data in CPS and the emerging areas that require attention. The research proposes a three-dimensional framework that considers: CPS (transportation, manufacturing, and others), Target (spatial-temporal data processing, anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, resource allocation, real-time decisions, and multi-modal data fusion), and DNN schemes (CNNs, RNNs, and GNNs).

Nevertheless, related work has shown that crime incident data can suffer from under-reporting bias whereby certain social groups report more crimes than others and whereby certain crimes are recorded more often by the police. In addition, under the umbrella of crime opportunity theories that suggest that human mobility can play a role in crime generation, increasing attention has been paid to the predictive power of human mobility in place-based crime models implemented with deep learning. However, prior work has shown that human mobility data collected from cell phones can suffer from sampling bias because certain population groups are not equally represented due to lack of cell phone ownership. Despite these well reported data bias concerns, no related work has yet looked into the fairness of place-based crime prediction models implemented with deep learning; nor into the effect that adding human mobility data from cell phones as a predictor might have on their fairness. In this paper, we use publicly available fine-grained crime incident and human mobility data from the US to conduct a comprehensive fairness audit across multiple cities with diverse demographic characteristics, different types of crimes and various deep learning models; and we explore potential root causes of the models' fairness metrics by looking into crime data bias, mobility data bias and algorithmic bias. Our results show that unfair predictions are pervasive across place-based crime prediction models implemented with deep-learning due to the inherent data bias in the crime incident data; that adding mobility features extracted from cell phone data decreases fairness under certain circumstances; and that part of the fairness loss can be explained by bias in the crime data, and in the predictive algorithms that might be exacerbating the data bias, with the mobility data bias having an insignificant effect on fairness loss. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Algorithmic fairness; Crime prediction; Data bias; Human mobility","Cellular telephones; Deep learning; Forecasting; Learning systems; Population statistics; Algorithmic fairness; Algorithmics; Cell phone; Crime prediction; Data bias; Human mobility; Mobility datum; Place-based; Prediction modelling; Related works; Crime; algorithm; crime; machine learning; modeling; prediction; United States","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (Grants #1750102 and #2210572).","","Elsevier Ltd","01989715","0080302017","CEUSD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151716359"

Many methods that can capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies from network topology and traffic sequence data have achieved remarkable results and become dominant in this task. However, the previous methods seldom consider the spatial information from the routing scheme, which also determines the flow direction and trend of network traffic. To fill this gap, we regard a routing path as a hyperedge and utilize a hypergraph instead of a simple graph to model network node connections based on the routing relevance. Then, we propose a novel multi-step network traffic prediction model named routing hypergraph convolutional recurrent network (RHCRN), which is built on the seq2seq structure with the hypergraph convolutional recurrent unit (HCRU). The HCRU is composed of the 2-layer hypergraph convolutional network (HGCN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). The node-edge-node transform process of the HGCN layer is ideal for exploring the complex spatial correlation between the routing paths and network nodes. The GRU is used to extract the temporal correlation from dynamic network traffic data. Extensive experiments on three real-world IP network datasets demonstrate that our model is robust and outperforms other advanced baseline models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hypergraph convolution; Network traffic prediction; Routing path; Spatiotemporal correlation","Complex networks; Forecasting; Graph theory; Internet protocols; Network routing; Network topology; Hyper graph; Hypergraph convolution; IP-network; Network node; Network traffic; Network traffic predictions; Recurrent networks; Routing path; Routings; Spatiotemporal correlation; Convolution","","","Springer","15737497; 0924669X","9780511611445; 9780521884280","APITE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143293001"

As the size of financial transaction data continues to grow, traditional machine-learning models are increasingly difficult to use for financial fraud detection. Some graph-learning methods have been widely used for Internet financial fraud detection, however, these methods ignore the stronger structural homogeneity and cannot aggregate features for two structurally similar but distant nodes. To address this problem, in this article, we propose a graph-learning algorithm TA-Struc2Vec for Internet financial fraud detection, which can learn topological features and transaction amount features in a financial transaction network graph and represent them as low-dimensional dense vectors, allowing intelligent and efficient classification and prediction by training classifier models.

Criminals use crypto money laundering to hide the illicit origin of funds using a variety of methods. The most simplified form of bitcoin money laundering leans hard on the fact that transactions made in cryptocurrencies are pseudonymous, but open data gives more power to investigators and enables the crowdsourcing of forensic analysis. With the motive to curb these illegal activities, there exist various rules, policies and technologies collectively known as anti-money laundering (AML) tools. When properly implemented, AML restrictions reduce the negative effects of illegal economic activity while also promoting financial market integrity and stability, but these bear high costs for institutions. The purpose of this work is to motivate the opportunity to reconcile the cause of safety with that of financial inclusion, bearing in mind the limitations of the available data. The authors use the Elliptic dataset; to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the largest labelled transaction dataset publicly available in any cryptocurrency. Design/methodology/approach: AML in bitcoin can be modelled as a node classification task in dynamic networks. In this work, graph convolutional decision forest will be introduced, which combines the potentialities of evolving graph convolutional network and deep neural decision forest (DNDF). This model will be used to classify the unknown transactions in the Elliptic dataset. Additionally, the application of knowledge distillation (KD) over the proposed approach gives finest results compared to all the other experimented techniques. Findings: The importance of utilising a concatenation between dynamic graph learning and ensemble feature learning is demonstrated in this work. The results show the superiority of the proposed model to classify the illicit transactions in the Elliptic dataset. Experiments also show that the results can be further improved when the system is fine-tuned using a KD framework. Originality/value: Existing works used either ensemble learning or dynamic graph learning to tackle the problem of AML in bitcoin.

The proliferation of positioning technology and location-based services has facilitated the expansion of association analysis across spatio-temporal scales. However, existing methods inadequately consider the scale differences among spatio-temporal objects during analysis, leading to suboptimal precision in association analysis results. To remedy this issue, we propose a multiscale spatio-temporal object representation method, STO2Vec, for association analysis. This method comprises of two parts: graph construction and embedding. For graph construction, we introduce an adaptive hierarchical discretization method to distinguish the varying scales of local features. Then, we merge the embedding method for spatio-temporal objects with that for discrete units, establishing a heterogeneous graph. For embedding, to enhance embedding quality for homogeneous and heterogeneous data, we use biased sampling and unsupervised models to capture the association strengths between spatio-temporal objects. Empirical results using real-world open-source datasets show that STO2Vec outperforms other models, improving accuracy by 16.25% on average across diverse applications. Further case studies indicate STO2Vec effectively detects association relationships between spatio-temporal objects in a range of scenarios and is applicable to tasks such as moving object behavior pattern mining and trajectory semantic annotation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adaptive discretization; association analysis; embedding; multiscale spatio-temporal objects","","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 41971362 and 42101432), the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (grant no. 2022JJ40546), and the Innovation Science Fund of NUDT (grant no. 22-ZZCX-058).","","MDPI","22209964","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160348271"

However, most studies are carried out in trip ends travel demand prediction, i.e., trip generation/attraction, while paying less attention to predicting OD flows in citywide traffic management. To this end, a novel generalized framework is proposed, named two-stage fusion framework (TFF). TFF consists of two stages, where the first stage utilizes an attention-based spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (AST-GCN) to predict the trip generation/attraction, and the second stage develops a modified Kalman filter (KF) to predict OD flow which is converted into a coefficient matrix. Lastly, the final predicted OD can be obtained by integrating the trip generation/attraction and the coefficient matrix. In AST-GCN, a gated fusion mechanism and dynamical zone proximity matrix are applied to improve the capacity of capturing the spatio-temporal interdependence among traffic analysis zones. In KF, we redefine the state vector and observed vector and their covariance matrixes, and then introduce the Box-Cox technique to standardize the deviation matrix to adapt to KF. The proposed model is tested on a large-scale real-world data set from Chongqing, China, and the results indicate that TFF can achieve a satisfactory performance of short-term OD prediction. Moreover, the proposed framework has the convenient scalability, because either of the two stages is replaceable by other predictors. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attention-based spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (AST-GCN); Kalman filter; Novel fusing framework; OD flow prediction; Short-term origin-destination (OD)","Convolution; Flow graphs; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Matrix algebra; Traffic control; Attention-based spatio-temporal graph convolutional network; Convolutional networks; Flow prediction; Fusing-framework; Novel fusing framework; Origin destination; Origin-destination flow prediction; Origin-destination flows; Short-term origin-destination; Spatio-temporal graphs; Kalman filters; artificial neural network; design; intelligent transportation system; Kalman filter; prediction; spatiotemporal analysis; traffic management; travel demand; China; Chongqing","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51878166 and 71701047) and China Scholarship Council (CSC: 202106090220).","","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)","24732907; 24732893","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150440784"

Existing studies infer crime locations or crime groups without considering individual GPS trajectory data. They ignore joint influence on crime patterns coming from the internal relationship between criminals, locations, and time. In this study, we propose Fusion Information Graph Attention Networks (FIGAT), which classifies individuals into high and low risks with personal movement time series and location trajectories. To solve the independence of individual crime behavior and the fusion information loss problem, FIGAT proposes Multi-dimension Fusion Information Graph to combine semantic correlation features with conventional person basic features, time features, and location features. FIGAT constructs a multi-relation graph attention layer, which utilizes the semantic relationship and node information to accurately classify individuals into high and low risks. We evaluate FIGAT with 14,625,884 GPS trajectories from 1038 individuals collected by a real-world public safety department. The results demonstrate that FIGAT improves F1 score by 41%, 32%, and 23% compared with legacy machine learning, RNN-based deep learning, and graph neural network SOTA methods, respectively.

The key challenge in developing the model is to capture the non-linear and dynamic spatial dependency and temporal patterns of a specific crime category, while keeping the underlying structure of the model interpretable. In this article, we develop AIST, an Attention-based Interpretable Spatio Temporal Network for crime prediction. AIST models the dynamic spatio-temporal correlations for a crime category based on past crime occurrences, external features (e.g., traffic flow and point of interest information) and recurring trends of crime.

However, obtaining a holistic spatial–temporal scene representation is difficult because places are often composed of multiple images from different angles, times and locations. This problem also exists in other types of geo-tagged imagery. To solve it, we propose a purely visual, robust, and reliable method for urban function identification at the street scale. We introduce a method based on a two-layer spatially dependent graph neural network structure, which handles sequential street view imagery as input (typically available in services such as Google Street View, Baidu Maps, and Mapillary), with full consideration of the spatial dependencies among road networks. In this paper, we construct an urban topological map network using OpenStreetMap data in Wuhan, China, and compute a semantic representation of the scene as a whole at the street scale using a large-scale pre-trained model. We construct the graph network with streets as nodes based on 28,693 mapping relationships constructed from 75,628 street view images and 5,458 streets. Only 5.3% of the node labels were required to obtain 10 categories of functions for all nodes in the study area. The results demonstrate that by using appropriate spatial weights, street encoder, and graph structure, our novel method achieves high accuracy of P@1 46.2%, P@3 73.0%, P@5 82.4%, and P@10 89.9%, fully demonstrating the effectiveness of the introduced approach. We also use the model to sense urban spatial–temporal renewal by computing time series street images. The model is also applicable to the prediction of other attributes, where only a small number of labels are required to obtain valid and reliable scene perception results.

While many efforts have been made for statically measuring and evaluating urban vibrancy, there are few studies on the evolutionary process of urban vibrancy, yet we know little about the relationship between urban vibrancy evolution and sophisticated spatiotemporal dynamics. In this article, we make use of multi-sourced urban data to develop a data-driven framework, U-Evolve, to investigate urban vibrancy evolution. Specifically, we first exploit the spatiotemporal characteristics of urban areas to create multi-view time-dependent graphs. Then, we analyze the contextual features and graph patterns of multi-view time-dependent graphs in terms of informing future urban vibrancy variations. Our analysis validates the informativeness of multi-view time-dependent graphs for characterizing and informing future urban vibrancy evolution. After that, we construct a feature based model to forecast future urban vibrancy evolution and quantify each feature's importance. Moreover, to further enhance the forecasting effectiveness, we propose a graph learning based model to capture spatiotemporal autocorrelation of urban areas based on multi-view time-dependent graphs in an end-to-end manner. Finally, extensive experiments on two metropolises, Beijing and Shanghai, demonstrate the effectiveness of our forecasting models.

However, malicious consumers tamper with their SMs to report low readings to reduce their bills. This problem, known as electricity fraud, causes tremendous financial losses to electric utility companies worldwide and threatens the power grid’s stability. To detect electricity fraud, several methods have been proposed in the literature. Among the existing methods, the data-driven methods achieve state-of-art performance. Therefore, in this paper, we study the main existing data-driven electricity fraud detection methods, with emphasis on their pros and cons. We study supervised methods, including wide and deep neural networks and multi-data-source deep learning models, and unsupervised methods, including clustering. Then, we investigate how to preserve the consumers’ privacy, using encryption and federated learning, while enabling electricity fraud detection because it has been shown that fine-grained readings can reveal sensitive information about the consumers’ activities. After that, we investigate how to design robust electricity fraud detectors against adversarial attacks using ensemble learning and model distillation because they enable malicious consumers to evade detection while stealing electricity. Finally, we provide a comprehensive comparison of the existing works, followed by our recommendations for future research directions to enhance electricity fraud detection. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adversarial attacks; clustering; deep learning; electricity fraud; ensemble learning; false data injection; privacy preservation; smart grid","Crime; Cryptography; Deep learning; Electric losses; Losses; Smart power grids; Adversarial attack; Clusterings; Data-driven methods; Electricity fraud; Ensemble learning; False data injection; Fraud detection; Privacy preservation; Smart grid; Learning systems","","","MDPI","19961073","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151403943"

Most previous works employed fixed neural architectures based on many complicated spatial and temporal learning modules. However, designing appropriate neural architectures is challenging for urban hotspot forecasting. One reason is that there is currently no adequate support system for how to fuse multi-scale spatio-temporal information rationally by integrating different spatial and temporal learning modules. Another one is that the empirical fixed neural architecture is difficult to adapt to different data scenarios from different domains or cities. To address the above problems, we propose a novel framework based on neural architecture search for urban hotspot forecasting, namely Automated Spatio-Temporal Information Fusion Neural Network (ASTIF-Net). In the search space of our ASTIF-Net, normal convolution and graph convolution operations are adopted to capture spatial geographic neighborhood dependencies and spatial semantic neighborhood dependencies, and different types of temporal convolution operations are adopted to capture short-term and long-term temporal dependencies. In addition to combining spatio-temporal learning operations from different scales, ASTIF-Net can also search appropriate fusion methods for aggregating multi-scale spatio-temporal hidden information. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate ASTIF-Net on three real-world urban hotspot datasets from different domains to demonstrate that our proposed model can obtain effective neural architectures and achieve superior performance (about 5%∼10% improvements) compared with the existing state-of-art baselines. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Information fusion; Neural architecture search; Spatio-temporal modeling; Urban hotspot forecasting","Convolution; Information fusion; Learning systems; Network architecture; Semantics; Hotspots; Learning modules; Neural architecture search; Neural architectures; Neural-networks; Spatial learning; Spatio-temporal models; Spatiotemporal information; Temporal learning; Urban hotspot forecasting; Forecasting","","","Elsevier Ltd","15684946","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147932716"

Although previous seminal works successfully leveraged graph convolutions to assist in the detection of anomalies, they failed to subsequently explore the potential of this approach. In this study, we developed a spatial–temporal graph attention network (STGA), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first effort to combine graph convolutions with a multi-head graph attention mechanism for video anomaly detection. Specifically, a spatial correlation graph and temporal dependence graph were devised to learn distinguishable representations with the complementation of graph attention techniques. Furthermore, STGA was incorporated within the multiple instance learning (MIL) pipeline, and optimized via top-k MIL ranking loss after a sparse continuous sampling strategy was put into effect. We conducted experiments using four multi-scale datasets to validate the efficacy of our model. Quantitatively, our method performs equivalently to the current best result on ShanghaiTech with a frame-level area under the curve (AUC) of 97.21%, obtains the second-best result on UCSD-Ped2 with a frame-level AUC of 97.4%, gains a frame-level AUC of 80.28% on UCF-Crime, and achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on TAD with a frame-level AUC of 91.42%. Additionally, our false alarm rate results outperform those obtained in previous studies on ShanghaiTech and UCF-Crime, which demonstrates the robustness of our approach.

Traditional human mobility traces (collected via telecommunication companies, online social media platforms, or field studies/experiments, etc.) suffer from severe data quality issues such as low precision, data sparsity, and insufficient coverage. In this paper, we investigate crowd flow prediction using Wi-Fi connection records on the campus of a university, which imply comprehensive, large-scale, high-coverage, and multi-grained (building/floor/room level) human mobility traces. However, we are facing not only non-trivial noises in the raw Wi-Fi connection data when extracting human mobility traces, but also the trade-off between location granularities and mobility patterns when modeling multi-grained crowd flow. Against this background, we propose CrowdTelescope, a Wi-Fi-positioning-based multi-grained spatiotemporal crowd flow prediction framework. We design a systematic approach for robust human mobility trace extraction from the noisy Wi-Fi connection records and adopt spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks to model multi-grained crowd flow under a unified graph model for the three-level location hierarchy. We also develop a prototype system of CrowdTelescope, providing the interactive visualization of crowd flows on campus. We evaluate CrowdTelescope by collecting a Wi-Fi connection dataset on the campus of the University of Macau. Results show that CrowdTelescope can effectively extract informative human mobility traces from the noisy Wi-Fi connection records with an improvement of 3.3% over baselines, and also accurately predict on-campus crowd flow across different location granularities with 1.5%- 24.1% improvements over baselines. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crowd flow; Mobility; Smart campus; Wi-Fi positioning","Economic and social effects; Flow graphs; Forecasting; Location; Social networking (online); Visualization; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Crowd flows; Flow prediction; Human mobility; Location based; Mobility; Mobility modeling; Mobility traces; Model forecasting; Smart campus; Wi-fi positioning; Wi-Fi","Funding text 1: This work is funded by the University of Macau (MYRG2022-00048-IOTSC) and the Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR (0038/2021/AGJ and SKL-IOTSC(UM)-2021-2023).

Although a lot of works have been proposed to deal with this problem, the performance in real applications is still relatively low. Here, to detect abnormal human behavior in videos, we propose a multiscale spatial temporal attention graph convolution network (MSTA-GCN) to capture and cluster the features of the human skeleton. First, based on the human skeleton graph, a multiscale spatial temporal attention graph convolution block (MSTA-GCB) is built which contains multiscale graphs in temporal and spatial dimensions. MSTA-GCB can simulate the motion relations of human body components at different scales where each scale corresponds to different granularity of annotation levels on the human skeleton. Then, static, globally-learned and attention-based adjacency matrices in the graph convolution module are proposed to capture hierarchical representation. Finally, extensive experiments are carried out on the ShanghaiTech Campus and CUHK Avenue datasets, the final results of the frame-level AUC/EER are 0.759/0.311 and 0.876/0.192, respectively. Moreover, the frame-level AUC is 0.768 for the human-related ShanghaiTech subset. These results show that our MSTA-GCN outperforms most of methods in video anomaly detection and we have obtained a new state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based anomaly behavior detection. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Multiscale spatial temporal graph; Skeleton-based anomaly behavior detection; Spatial attention graph convolution","Anomaly detection; Behavioral research; Crime; Musculoskeletal system; Behavior detection; Human skeleton; Multiscale spatial temporal graph; Performance; Real applications; Skeleton-based anomaly behavior detection; Spatial attention; Spatial attention graph convolution; Spatial temporals; Temporal graphs; Convolution","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China [grant number 2021YFE0110500 ]; the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 62202499 , 61872034 , 62062021 , and 62011530042 ]; the Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation, China [grant number 4202055 ] and the central guiding local funding project of Guizhou Provincial Science and Technology Department, China [grant number [2021] 4023 ].","","Academic Press Inc.","10473203; 10959076","","JVCRE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143540944"

To this end, we propose a spatio-temporal deep fusion graph convolution network (STDGCN), which embodies the intra-region spatio-temporal features and the inter-region spatio-temporal associations on a single graph.

With the ubiquitous use of social media and the prosperous developments in machine and deep learning, it has become feasible to collect and process massive amounts of information produced by online communities about their perceptions of heritage as social constructs. Moreover, such information is usually inter-connected and embedded within specific socioeconomic and spatiotemporal contexts. This paper presents a methodological workflow for using semi-supervised learning with graph neural networks (GNN) to classify, summarize, and map cultural significance categories based on user-generated content on social media. Several GNN models were trained as an ensemble to incorporate the multi-modal (visual and textual) features and the contextual (temporal, spatial, and social) connections of social media data in an attributed multi-graph structure. The classification results with different models were aligned and evaluated with the prediction confidence and agreement. Furthermore, message diffusion methods on graphs were proposed to aggregate the post labels onto their adjacent spatial nodes, which helps to map the cultural significance categories in their geographical contexts. The workflow is tested on data gathered from Venice as a case study, demonstrating the generation of social perception maps for this UNESCO World Heritage property. This research framework could also be applied in other cities worldwide, contributing to more socially inclusive heritage management processes. Furthermore, the proposed methodology holds the potential of diffusing any human-generated location-based information onto spatial networks and temporal timelines, which could be beneficial for measuring the safety, vitality, and/or popularity of urban spaces. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Graph Neural Networks; Heritage Values and Attributes; Label Diffusion; Multi-modal Machine Learning; Social Media Data; Spectral Centrality","","","","TU Delft","22147233; 22123202","9789492516800; 9789492516312; 9789492516398; 9789461866523; 9789492516817; 9789492516831; 9789461867094; 9789461866271; 9789492516190; 9789492516756","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204723299"

Previous works have designed various deep-learning methods using historical records to predict traffic accident occurrences. However, there is a lack of consensus on how accurate existing methods are, and a fundamental issue is the lack of public accident datasets for comprehensive evaluations. This paper constructs a large-scale, unified dataset of traffic accident records from official reports of various states in the US, totaling 9 million records, accompanied by road networks and traffic volume reports. Using this new dataset, we evaluate existing deep-learning methods for predicting the occurrence of accidents on road networks. Our main finding is that graph neural networks such as GraphSAGE can accurately predict the number of accidents on roads with less than 22% mean absolute error (relative to the actual count) and whether an accident will occur or not with over 87% AUROC, averaged over states. We achieve these results by using multitask learning to account for cross-state variabilities (e.g., availability of accident labels) and transfer learning to combine traffic volume with accident prediction. Ablation studies highlight the importance of road graph-structural features, amongst other features. Lastly, we discuss the implications of the analysis and develop a package for easily using our new dataset. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Deep learning; Highway accidents; Motor transportation; Transfer learning; Accident analysis; Graph neural networks; Learning methods; Network connection; Network traffic; Network-based; Road network; Road safety; Safety modelling; Traffic volumes","Acknowledgement.

Existing equivariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) based methods have encapsulated the symmetry of physics, e.g., translations, rotations, etc, leading to better generalization ability. Nevertheless, their frame-to-frame formulation of the task overlooks the non-Markov property mainly incurred by unobserved dynamics in the environment. In this paper, we reformulate dynamics simulation as a spatio-temporal prediction task, by employing the trajectory in the past period to recover the Non-Markovian interactions. We propose Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Attentive Graph Networks (ESTAG), an equivariant version of spatio-temporal GNNs, to fulfill our purpose. At its core, we design a novel Equivariant Discrete Fourier Transform (EDFT) to extract periodic patterns from the history frames, and then construct an Equivariant Spatial Module (ESM) to accomplish spatial message passing, and an Equivariant Temporal Module (ETM) with the forward attention and equivariant pooling mechanisms to aggregate temporal message.

However, neighbor aggregation, a critical building block of graph networks, for temporal graphs, is currently straightforwardly extended from that of static graphs. It can be computationally expensive when involving all historical neighbors during such aggregation. In practice, typically only a subset of the most recent neighbors are involved. However, such subsampling leads to incomplete and biased neighbor information. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework for temporal neighbor aggregation that uses the recurrent neural network with node-wise hidden states to integrate information from all historical neighbors for each node to acquire the complete neighbor information. We demonstrate the superior theoretical expressiveness of the proposed framework as well as its state-of-the-art performance in real-world applications.

While advanced end-to-end models have achieved notable success in improving predictive performance, their integration and expansion pose significant challenges. This work aims to address these challenges by introducing a spatio-temporal pre-training framework that seamlessly integrates with downstream baselines and enhances their performance. The framework is built upon two key designs: (i) We propose a spatio-temporal mask autoencoder as a pre-training model for learning spatio-temporal dependencies. The model incorporates customized parameter learners and hierarchical spatial pattern encoding networks. These modules are specifically designed to capture spatio-temporal customized representations and intra- and inter-cluster region semantic relationships, which have often been neglected in existing approaches. (ii) We introduce an adaptive mask strategy as part of the pre-training mechanism. This strategy guides the mask autoencoder in learning robust spatio-temporal representations and facilitates the modeling of different relationships, ranging from intra-cluster to inter-cluster, in an easy-to-hard training manner.

Recognizing the significant implications of these events, urban managers strive to proactively prevent them by accurately predicting their future occurrence. However, existing methods overlook crucial contextual information within urban scenarios while mining spatio-temporal dependencies in single event series. Fortunately, we discovered a connection between meteorological conditions and uncivilized events. To leverage this relationship, we propose a novel approach named the Meteorology-Assisted Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (MAST) which integrates meteorological information into the spatio-temporal dependency modeling for predicting urban uncivilized events. Additionally, our approach captures latent regularities in human behavior by explicitly modeling individuals' psychological states based on meteorological information. We also adopt cross-view contrastive learning between urban regions to dynamically capture the informative components of meteorological information for precise prediction of urban uncivilized events.

Late predictions may result in tremendous economic costs and human life loss, while inaccurate predictions are likely to cause unnecessary public resources and social anxiety. Therefore, balancing accuracy and timeliness is essential in general spatiotemporal event prediction problems. In this paper, we propose an Early Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ESTGCN) 1 to adaptively determine the optimal prediction time, which makes a tradeoff between prediction accuracy and timeliness and addresses two major questions: 1) How can we determine optimal prediction time points for different areas, taking into account their unique characteristics and conditions? 2) How can we minimize the propagation of prediction errors throughout the forecast timeline? Extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed approaches can give an optimal prediction time in advance for each area and outperform all baselines in early spatiotemporal prediction tasks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","early prediction; graph convolution network; reinforcement learning","Adaptive control systems; Computer vision; Convolutional neural networks; Forecasting; Large datasets; Reinforcement learning; Traffic congestion; Adaptive controllers; Early prediction; Economic costs; Embeddings; Event prediction; Graph convolution network; Optimal predictions; Prediction time; Reinforcement learnings; Spatiotemporal event; Convolution","This research was supported by NVIDIA Academic Hardware Grant Program and utilized NVIDIA Quadro RTX8000.","Chen, G.; Khan, L.; Gao, X.; Qiu, M.; Pedrycz, W.; Wu, X.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15504786","9780769527024; 9781665450997; 0769530192; 0769517544; 9781665423984; 9780769530192; 9780769530185; 0769527019; 9781728183169; 9780769542560","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185400275"

It helps to implement rich and varied transportation applications and bring convenient transportation services to people based on collected traffic data. Most existing methods usually leverage graph-based deep learning networks to model the complex road network for traffic forecasting shallowly. Despite their effectiveness, these methods are generally limited in fully capturing high-order spatial dependencies caused by road network topology and high-order temporal dependencies caused by traffic dynamics. To tackle the above issues, we focus on the essence of traffic system and propose STHODE: Spatio-Temporal Hypergraph Neural Ordinary Differential Equation Network, which combines road network topology and traffic dynamics to capture high-order spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic data. Technically, STHODE consists of a spatial module and a temporal module. On the one hand, we construct a spatial hypergraph and leverage an adaptive MixHop hypergraph ODE network to capture high-order spatial dependencies. On the other hand, we utilize a temporal hypergraph and employ a hyperedge evolving ODE network to capture high-order temporal dependencies. Finally, we aggregate the outputs of stacked STHODE layers to mutually enhance the prediction performance.

Antibiograms help clinicians to understand regional resistance rates and select appropriate antibiotics in prescriptions. In practice, significant combinations of antibiotic resistance may appear in different antibiograms, forming antibiogram patterns. Such patterns may imply the prevalence of some infectious diseases in certain regions. Thus it is of crucial importance to monitor antibiotic resistance trends and track the spread of multi-drug resistant organisms. In this paper, we propose a novel problem of antibiogram pattern prediction that aims to predict which patterns will appear in the future. Despite its importance, tackling this problem encounters a series of challenges and has not yet been explored in the literature. First of all, antibiogram patterns are not i.i.d as they may have strong relations with each other due to genomic similarities of the underlying organisms. Second, antibiogram patterns are often temporally dependent on the ones that are previously detected. Furthermore, the spread of antibiotic resistance can be significantly influenced by nearby or similar regions. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Antibiogram Pattern Prediction framework, STAPP, that can effectively leverage the pattern correlations and exploit the temporal and spatial information. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world dataset with antibiogram reports of patients from 1999 to 2012 for 203 cities in the United States. The experimental results show the superiority of STAPP against several competitive baselines. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","antibiogram patterns; antibiotic resistance; attention mechanism; spatial-temporal learning","Antibiotics; Genome; Antibiogram pattern; Antibiograms; Antibiotics resistance; Antimicrobial drug; Attention mechanisms; Infected patients; Spatial temporals; Spatial-temporal learning; Temporal learning; Temporal networks; Forecasting","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work is supported by the National Center for Advancing Translational Science (UL1TR003015, KL2TR003016 to G.R.M.), the National Science Foundation grants (IIS-2006844, IIS-2144209, IIS-2223769, CCF-1918656, CNS-2041952, and IIS-1955797), the National Institutes of Health grant 2R01GM109718-07, and the CDC MInD Healthcare network cooperative agreement U01CK000589.

The complexity of GNN training and the scalability challenges have also sparked interest from the systems community, with efforts to build systems that provide higher efficiency and schemes to reduce costs. However, we observe that many such systems basically “reinvent the wheel” of much work done in the database world on scalable graph analytics engines. Further, they often tightly couple the scalability treatments of graph data processing with that of GNN training, resulting in entangled complex problems and systems that often do not scale well on one of those axes. In this paper, we ask a fundamental question: How far can we push existing systems for scalable graph analytics and deep learning (DL) instead of building custom GNN systems? Are compromises inevitable on scalability and/or runtimes? We propose Lotan, the first scalable and optimized data system for full-batch GNN training with decoupled scaling that bridges the hitherto siloed worlds of graph analytics systems and DL systems. Lotan offers a series of technical innovations, including re-imagining GNN training as query plan-like dataflows, execution plan rewriting, optimized data movement between systems, a GNN-centric graph partitioning scheme, and the first known GNN model batching scheme. We prototyped Lotan on top of GraphX and PyTorch. An empirical evaluation using several real-world benchmark GNN workloads reveals a promising nuanced picture: Lotan significantly surpasses the scalability of state-of-the-art custom GNN systems, while often matching or being only slightly behind on time-to-accuracy metrics in some cases. We also show the impact of our system optimizations. Overall, our work shows that the GNN world can indeed benefit from building on top of scalable graph analytics engines. Lotan’s new level of scalability can also empower new ML-oriented research on ever-larger graphs and GNNs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Complex networks; Data flow analysis; Data handling; Deep learning; Engines; Graph neural networks; Query processing; Build systems; Complex problems; Existing systems; Graph data; Graph-analytic; Higher efficiency; Neural network systems; Neural networks trainings; Reduce costs; Scalability","This work was supported in part by an NSF CAREER Award under award number 1942724 and a gift from VMware.

Understanding the influencing factors is pivotal for enhancing these settlements. This study focuses on 34 prefecture-level cities in Northeastern China from 2005 to 2020. It employs a modified gravitational model to establish spatial relationships among urban human settlements. Social network analysis techniques, including modularity and the quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) regression model, are introduced to analyze the network's characteristics and driving factors. Methods: A modified gravitational model is applied to create the spatial association network of urban human settlements. Social network analysis tools, along with modularity and the QAP regression model, are utilized to investigate the network's attributes and influencing elements. The study evaluates the evolution of spatial correlation, network cohesion, hierarchy, and efficiency. Results: Throughout the study period, spatial correlation among urban human settlements in Northeastern China progressively intensified. However, the network exhibited relatively low density (0.217675), implying limited interconnectivity among cities. The average network hierarchy was 0.178225, indicating the need for optimization, while the average network efficiency was 0.714025, reflecting fewer redundant relationships. The analysis reveals the emergence of a polycentric network pattern with core and sub-core cities like Shenyang, Dalian, Changchun, Daqing, and Harbin. The urban network configuration has largely stabilized. The spatial association network showcases the intertwining of ""small groups"" and community organizations. Geographic proximity and merit-based linkages govern feature flow. Measures such as breaking administrative barriers, reducing flow time and distance, boosting resident income, and increasing government investment are identified to foster balanced network development and structural optimization. Discussion: The research underscores the increasing spatial correlation and evolving network pattern among urban human settlements in Northeastern China. Despite the observed strengthening correlation, challenges related to network cohesion and hierarchy persist. The formation of a polycentric network signifies positive progress in urban development. The study highlights the importance of proximity and merit-based connections for feature flow. The proposed measures offer pathways to enhance network development and optimize structure, promoting holistic urban settlement growth and sustainability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","feature flow; human settlements; influencing factors; Northeastern China; spatially associative structure","","","","Frontiers Media SA","2296701X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171875745"

Several techniques utilizing deep learning have been created to detect anomalies, yet their effectiveness on real-world data is often limited due to the insufficient incorporation of motion patterns. To address these problems and enhance the traditional functionality of anomaly detection systems for surveillance video data, we propose a weakly supervised graph neural-network-assisted video anomaly detection framework called AD-Graph. To identify temporal information from a series of frames, we extract 3D visual and motion features and represent these in a language-based knowledge graph format. Next, a robust clustering strategy is applied to group together meaningful neighbourhoods of the graph with similar vertices. Furthermore, spectral filters are applied to these graphs, and spectral graph theory is used to generate graph signals and detect anomalous events.

The problem is typically solved by modeling complex spatio-temporal correlations in traffic data using spatio-temporal graph neural networks (GNNs). However, the performance of these methods is still far from satisfactory since GNNs usually have limited representation capacity when it comes to complex traffic networks. Graphs, by nature, fall short in capturing non-pairwise relations. Even worse, existing methods follow the paradigm of message passing that aggregates neighborhood information linearly, which fails to capture complicated spatio-temporal high-order interactions. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel model named Dynamic Hypergraph Structure Learning (DyHSL) for traffic flow prediction. To learn non-pairwise relationships, our DyHSL extracts hypergraph structural information to model dynamics in the traffic networks, and updates each node representation by aggregating messages from its associated hyperedges. Additionally, to capture high-order spatio-temporal relations in the road network, we introduce an interactive graph convolution block, which further models the neighborhood interaction for each node. Finally, we integrate these two views into a holistic multi-scale correlation extraction module, which conducts temporal pooling with different scales to model different temporal patterns. Extensive experiments on four popular traffic benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DyHSL compared with a broad range of competing baselines. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","dynamic hypergraph; hypergraph structure learning; traffic flow forecasting","Complex networks; Forecasting; Graph neural networks; Graph theory; Roads and streets; Dynamic hypergraph; Hyper graph; Hypergraph structure learning; Road network; Structure-learning; Traffic conditions; Traffic flow forecasting; Traffic networks; Message passing","This paper is partially supported by grants from the National Key Research and Development Program of China with Grant No. 2018AAA0101902 and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC Grant Number 62276002).","","IEEE Computer Society","23750286; 10844627","9781424408030; 1424408032; 9781665408837; 9780769535456; 9781509065431; 9781479925544; 081860655X; 1424408326; 0769522858; 0769525709","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167728857"

With the proliferation of individual-level geospatial big data, previous studies have widely used the network abstraction model to reveal the underlying urban spatial structure. However, the construction of network abstraction models primarily focuses on the topology of the road network without considering individual travel flows along with the road networks. Individual travel flows reflect the urban dynamics, which can further help understand the underlying spatial structure. This study therefore aims to reveal the intra-urban hierarchical spatial structure by integrating the road network abstraction model and individual travel flows. To achieve this goal, we 1) quantify the spatial interaction relatedness of road segments based on the Word2Vec model using large volumes of taxi trip data, then 2) characterize the road abstraction network model according to the identified spatial interaction relatedness, and 3) implement a community detection algorithm to reveal sub-regions of a city. Our results reveal three levels of hierarchical spatial structures in the Wuhan metropolitan area. This study provides a data-driven approach to the investigation of urban spatial structure via identifying traffic interaction patterns on the road network, offering insights to urban planning practice and transportation management. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","network abstraction model; road network; taxi trajectory data; Urban spatial structure","network analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; travel behavior; urban area; urban development; urbanization; China","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 41871311]; Guangdong Science and Technology Strategic Innovation Fund (the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Joint Laboratory Program, Project No. 2020B1212030009); and the Fundamental Research Funds for National Universities, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan); China Scholarship Council (CSC) during a visit of Sheng Hu to National University of Singapore.","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","19475683; 19475691","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166673257"

To address these challenges in weakly labeled datasets, we propose a novel custom loss function in conjunction with the multi-instance learning (MIL) algorithm. Our approach utilizes the UCF Crime and ShanghaiTech datasets for anomaly detection. The UCF Crime dataset includes labeled videos depicting a range of incidents such as explosions, assaults, and burglaries, while the ShanghaiTech dataset is one of the largest anomaly datasets, with over 400 video clips featuring three different scenes and 130 abnormal events. We generated pseudo labels for videos using the MIL technique to detect frame-level anomalies from video-level annotations, and to train the network to distinguish between normal and abnormal classes. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF Crime dataset using C3D and I3D features to test our model's performance. For the ShanghaiTech dataset, we used I3D features for training and testing. Our results show that with I3D features, we achieve an 84.6% frame-level AUC score for the UCF Crime dataset and a 92.27% frame-level AUC score for the ShanghaiTech dataset, which are comparable to other methods used for similar datasets. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3d convolutional neural network; anomaly detection; multi-instance learning; spatio-temporal analysis","","","","J.J.

The emergence of spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) provides a new insight for solving the problem of obtaining spatial correlation for spatiotemporal graph data prediction while achieving state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, a comprehensive survey of research on ST-GNNs prediction domain is presented, where the background of ST-GNNs is introduced before the computational paradigm of ST-GNN is thoroughly reviewed. From the perspective of model construction, 59 well-known models in recent years are classified and discussed. Some of these models are further analyzed in terms of performance and efficiency. Subsequently, the categories and application fields of spatiotemporal graph data are summarized, providing a clear idea of technology selection for different applications.

To extract stable and robust feature representations，the challenge issue of GReID is to model the temporal changes and intra-group pedestrians. Our summary is reviewed on the growth of GReID critically. First，we review its research domain in related to its basic concepts，technologies and datasets in relevance. To optimize the surveillance in public security，the GReID can monitor and prevent group-based crimes accurately like women and children-oriented kid⁃ napping and trafficking. Due to pedestrians-targeted are severely occluded or even disappeared，it can leverage the appear⁃ ance features of pedestrians’partners as additional prior information for recognition. Specifically，GReID-based groups are composed of 2 to 8 members. First，the same group can be identified when the identified intersection-over-union（IoU）ratio of member is greater than 60% in the two group images. Then，a variety of GReID algorithms are introduced and tested in detail. The existing works can be categorized from three perspectives：1）data，2）method，and 3）label. For data types，the existing methods can be segmented into：real image-based，synthetic images-based，and real video-based methods. The real images-based method is basically focused on the datasets collected from real surveillance scenarios，such as CUHK-SYSU Group（CSG），RoadGroup，iLIDS-MCTS，and etc. These datasets can be used to collect several group images from different camera views of different groups and provide the elements of location information and identifica⁃ tion information of member. This supervision information can be used to design discriminative group feature representa⁃ tions. However，it is still more challenging to collect and label the real group datasets than the traditional pedestrian reidentification datasets because the consistent group identity is required to be judged between group images，including mem⁃ ber variations and layout variations. The following datasets are proposed based on 3D synthetic images. This type of datas⁃ ets can generate mass group images with high-quality labels efficiency and effectively. These methods can be used to improve the performances of the model in real datasets through massive synthetic data. The video-based datasets can pro⁃ vide several consecutive frames for each group from the surveillance videos. Researchers can extract the group features according to the potential patio-temporal or intra-group relationships. They can be mainly divided into：traditional methods and deep learning methods. The former one is to design group descriptors and extract group features derived of human expe⁃ rience. However，due to the high dependence on the prior knowledge of expertise，it is unable to describe and generalize all possible situations for group images. The model can construct the representations of group images automatically because the emerging deep learning based methods is beneficial for a large number of data samples，and the discrimination and robustness of the deep models have been significantly improved. Deep learning-based methods can be divided into 1）the feature learning-based，2）metric learning based，and 3）generative adversarial network（GAN）based. The deep feature learning based methods aim to design a discriminative network structure or a discriminative feature learning strategy. The features-extracted can reflect the group identification of the input images accurately，and it can be robust enough to sup⁃ press occlusion，illumination，number and layout variations of intra-group members. Metric learning based methods can be focused on a similarity criterion evaluation between two groups of images. To get high similarity under the designed mea⁃ surement criteria，even two group images from the same group class have great differences. To optimize small size of the dataset，GAN-based method attempts to expand the dataset scale of the GReID task by style transfer of samples from other related pedestrian re-identification datasets. For its label，the existing methods can be categorized into：supervised and unsupervised. Supervised learning based methods tend to be more competitive because the group labels or the member labels are participated in the entire training process. It often can learn the similarity only for the local area of the group images because labels are not be provided in the unsupervised learning，and cluster methods can be designed to extract the feature representations of the same group class. To sum up，1）the specific scenarios based GReID is required to be devel⁃ oped from the aspects of data collection and method design further；2）GReID is still not interrelated to other related visual tasks mutually. Therefore，multiple tasks-collaborated are called to resolve more industry needs，and the implementation of the industry is required to be accelerated for the domain of academia and industry. Furthermore，the data privacy policy-relevant ethic issue needs to be utilized for virtual data and real data in the future. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","deep learning; feature learn⁃ ing; group re-identification（GReID）; metric learning; pedestrian re-identification; synthesis data; Transformer","","Supported by：National Natural Science Foundation of China（62076258）；Project of Ministry of Public Security of China（2019GABJC39）","","Editorial and Publishing Board of JIG","10068961","","","","Chinese","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162880281"

In this context, there is an increasing trend of proposing and improving methodologies to gather and use vast amounts of Spatio-Temporal data. Spatio Temporal Forecasting (STF) problems present complex interactions and non-linearities as the temporal dimension and the spatial one are usually entangled. To address these problems, statistical, Machine Learning based, and Deep Learning based models are introduced and developed. The use of exogenous data has proven to be beneficial in many STF models. Various techniques of incorporating exogenous data in STF problems have been proposed in the literature. This survey aims at providing a systematic review of the data-driven STF models, with a focus on those that incorporate exogenous data. We first investigate the data properties, including their dynamics, types and representations. Next, we propose a new taxonomy of the reviewed models and inspect the different complexities of STF problems. Exogenous data incorporation techniques are then presented and analyzed.

Prediction of these anomalies at the early stages may prevent significant loss and help the government to maintain urban sustainability. However, predicting different kinds of urban anomaly is difficult because of its dynamic nature (e.g., holiday versus weekday, office versus shopping mall) and presence in various forms (e.g., road congestion may be caused by blocked driveway or accident). This work proposes a novel integrated framework UrbanAnom that utilizes a data fusion approach to predict urban anomaly data using gated graph convolution and recurrent unit.

Many flames that are of interest to scientists and engineers are turbulent and thus inherently three-dimensional, especially in practical combustors, which often contain multiple interacting flames. Fortunately, combustion leads to the emission of light, both spontaneously and in response to laser-based stimulation. Therefore, images of a flame convey path-integrated information about the source of light, and a tomography algorithm can be used to reconstruct the spatial distribution of the light source, called emission tomography. In a carefully designed experiment, reconstructions can be post-processed using chemical kinetic, spectroscopic, and/or transport models to extract quantitative information. This information can be invaluable for benchmarking numerical solutions, and volumetric emission tomography is increasingly relied upon to paint a more complete picture of combustion than point, linear, or planar tools. Steady reductions in the cost of optical equipment and computing power, improvements in imaging technology, and advances in reconstruction algorithms have enabled a suite of three-dimensional sensors that are regularly used to characterize combustion. Four emission modalities are considered in this review: chemiluminescence, laser-induced fluorescence, passive incandescence, and laser-induced incandescence. The review covers the reconstruction algorithms, imaging models, camera calibration techniques, signal physics, instrumentation, and post-processing methods needed to conduct volumetric emission tomography and interpret the results. Limitations of each method are discussed and a survey of key applications is presented. The future of volumetric combustion diagnostics is considered, with special attention paid to the advent and promise of machine learning as well as spectrally-resolved volumetric measurement techniques. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chemiluminescence; Combustion diagnostics; Fluorescence; Incandescence; Tomography; Volumetric imaging","Chemiluminescence; Fluorescence; Image reconstruction; Light sources; Optical data processing; Tomography; Combustion diagnostics; Combustion pro-cess; Emission tomography; Incandescence; Integrated informations; Laser-based; Reconstruction algorithms; Scientists and engineers; Volumetric Imaging; Volumetrics; Combustion","Funding text 1: The authors thank Yair Censor, Gabor Herman, Thomas Dreier, Bernhard Wieneke, Stefan Will, and Florian Bauer for their thoughtful comments and critiques.

Existing methods typically use deep learning to capture the intra-dependencies in spatial and temporal dimensions. However, numerous key challenges remain unsolved, for instance, sparse zero-inflated data due to crimes occurring with low frequency (which can lead to poor performance on real-world datasets), and both intra-and inter-dependencies of criminal patterns across spatial, temporal, and semantic (i.e., categories of crimes) dimensions. In this paper, we propose STS to jointly capture the intra-and inter-dependencies between the crime patterns and the influential factors in three dimensions. Further, we use a multi-Task prediction module with a customized loss function to solve the zero-inflated issue. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of STS, which outperforms state-of-The-Art methods by 26.02% and 18.95% in the mean absolute error and the root mean square error, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crime prediction; Data mining; Graph neural network; Multi-head attention; Zero-inflated spatiotemporal data","Data mining; Deep learning; Forecasting; Graph neural networks; Learning systems; Mean square error; Semantics; Crime prediction; Inter-dependencies; Learning methods; Multi-head attention; Real-world datasets; Spatio-temporal data; Urban safety; Zero-inflated; Zero-inflated spatiotemporal data; Crime","This work is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFC3300502).","","Association for Computing Machinery","","9781450398343","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158046185"

Under the umbrella of the crime opportunity theory, that suggests that human mobility can play a role in crime generation, increasing attention has been paid to the predictive power of human mobility in place-based short-term crime models. Researchers have used call detail records (CDR), data from location-based services such as Foursquare or from social media to characterize human mobility; and have shown that mobility metrics, together with historical crime data, can improve short-term crime prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose to use a publicly available fine-grained human mobility dataset from a location intelligence company to explore the effects of human mobility features on short-term crime prediction. For that purpose, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple cities with diverse demographic characteristics, different types of crimes and various deep learning models; and we show that adding human mobility flow features to historical crimes can improve the F1 scores for a variety of neural crime prediction models across cities and types of crimes, with improvements ranging from 2% to 7%.

This has led to the development of on-street parking systems that typically ensure that parking spaces will be available for the local population, as well as provide easy access to parking for visitors, e.g., by providing directions for finding sectors where parking slots are available. Unfortunately, such systems are affected by illegal parking, i.e., parking without paying the parking fee, since in this case, the number of registered parked cars does not match the number of cars that are actually parked, leading to providing incorrect suggestions to drivers. This can discourage drivers from using such systems, potentially further increasing the parking violation rate. Such phenomena can be addressed by using smart sensors that can detect the presence of cars in various areas. However, installing and maintaining such systems is costly, which usually discourage cities from implementing such solutions. The main contribution of this paper is a Deep Learning (DL)-based pipeline that works in an indirect way (i.e., without using sensors) and allows for developing an accurate fine-grained parking violation prediction system, increasing in this way the accuracy of the information provided to on-street parking systems with minimal cost. To deal with missing and noisy data we also propose a data augmentation and smoothing technique that can further improve the accuracy of DL models, when used in such scenarios. The effectiveness of the developed system is validated using experiments on a large-scale dataset, which contains more than 3.9 million scans for illegally parked cars collected by the municipal police in Thessaloniki, Greece. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep learning; Illegal parking; Parking Violation Rate Prediction","Crime; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Deep learning; Illegal parking; Neural-networks; On-street parking; Parking spaces; Parking violation rate prediction; Parking violations; Rate predictions; Street parking systems; Violation rates; Large dataset","","","Elsevier B.V.","01678655","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140777909"

Considering the co-evolutionary patterns of crowd distribution, the interactions among places are essential for modelling crowd distribution variations. However, two issues remain. First, the lack of sampling design in passive big data acquisition makes the spatial interaction characterizations of less crowded places insufficient. Second, the multi-order spatial interactions among places can help forecasting crowd distribution but are rarely considered in the existing literature. To address these issues, a novel crowd distribution forecasting method with multi-order spatial interactions was proposed. In particular, a weighted random walk algorithm was applied to generate simulated trajectories for improving the interaction characterizations derived from sparse mobile phone data. The multi-order spatial interactions among contextual non-adjacent places were modelled with an embedding learning technique. The future crowd distribution was forecasted via a graph-based deep neural network. The proposed method was verified using a real-world mobile phone dataset, and the results showed that both the multi-order spatial interactions and the trajectory data enhancement algorithm helped improve the crowd distribution forecasting performance. The proposed method can be utilized for capturing fine-grained crowd distribution, which supports various applications such as intelligent transportation management and public health decision making. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crowd distribution forecasting; Embedding learning; Human mobility; Multi-order spatial interaction; Trajectory enhancement","Cellular telephones; Data acquisition; Decision making; Deep neural networks; Embeddings; Probes; Spatial distribution; Trajectories; Crowd distribution forecasting; Embedding learning; Fine grained; Human mobility; Mobile phone datum; Multi-order spatial interaction; Multi-ordering; Spatial interaction; Trajectory enhancement; Forecasting; decision making; forecasting method; mobile phone; prediction; public transport; spatiotemporal analysis; traffic management; transportation development","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China: [Grant No. 42101463, No. 42071360, No. 42271474, No. 71961137003]; the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation: [Grant No. 2021 M692164]; the Guangdong Province Basic and Applied Basic Research Fund Project: [Grant No. 2020A1515111166]; and a grant from State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System.","","Elsevier Ltd","0968090X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139591937"

In crowded areas possibility of occurrence of suspicious activities and violence automatically increases. To attenuate these issues, it is very important to develop automated systems that can detect anomalies in the diverse and complex outdoor environments, especially at public places to ensure safety and to avoid crowd disasters such as human stampede, mob lynching, and riots. Crowd management may help to circumvent the crowd disaster and ensure public safety at places like temples, railway stations, airports, bus terminals, religious functions, political rallies etc. We need a visual surveillance that can automatically detect abnormality in crowd behavior so that the relevant action can be taken to prevent any public casualty. Basic steps required for crowd analysis is density estimation and crowd counting, object recognition, tracking, and anomaly detection in crowded scene.

Predictable ride-hailing demand can facilitate more reasonable vehicle scheduling and online car-hailing platform dispatch. Conventional deep learning methods with no external structured data can be accomplished via hybrid models of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) by meshing plentiful pixel-level labeled data, but data sparsity of high grid granularity in spatial perspective and limited learning capabilities of long-term dependencies in temporal perspective are still two striking bottlenecks. To address these problems, we propose a novel virtual graph modeling approach to focus on significant demand regions and a novel Deep Multi-View Spatio-temporal Virtual Graph Neural Network (DMVST-VGNN) to strengthen the learning capabilities of spatial dynamics and long-term temporal dependencies. Specifically, DMVST-VGNN integrates structures of 1D CNN, Multi-Graph Attention Neural Network and Transformer Network, which correspond to short-term temporal dynamics view, spatial dynamics view and long-term temporal dynamics view respectively. In this paper, multiple experiments are conducted on two large-scale New York City datasets in higher granularity prediction scenes. And the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DMVST-VGNN framework in ride-hailing demand prediction, no matter in spatial scale or the temporal scale. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Graph neural network; Multi-view modeling; Ride-hailing demand prediction; Spatio-temporal analysis","Convolutional neural networks; Dynamics; Graph neural networks; Graphic methods; Intelligent systems; Large dataset; Learning systems; Recurrent neural networks; Scheduling; Virtual addresses; Convolutional neural network; Demand prediction; Learning capabilities; Multi-view modeling; Multi-views; Ride-hailing demand prediction; Spatio-temporal; Spatiotemporal analysis; Virtual graph; Forecasting; article; attention; convolutional neural network; learning; New York; prediction; spatiotemporal analysis","","","Elsevier B.V.","18728286; 09252312","","NRCGE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137734881"

Building function recognition is incredibly valuable for wide applications ranging from the determination of energy demand. By aiming at the topic of urban function classification, a semi-supervised graph structure network combined unified message passing model was introduced. The data of this model include spatial location distribution of buildings, building characteristics and the information mined from points of interesting (POIs). In order to extract the context information, each building was regarded as a graph node. Building characteristics and corresponding POIs information were embedded to mine the building function by the graph convolutional neural network. When training the model, several node labels in the graph were masked, and then these labels were predicted by the trained model so that this work could take full advantage of the node label and the feature information of all nodes in both the training and prediction stages. Quasi-experiments proved that the proposed method for building function classification using multi-source data enables the model to capture more meaningful information with limited labels, and it achieves better function classification results. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","building function classification; graph neural network; POI; semi-supervised learning","","Open Fund of Key Laboratory of Urban Land Resources Monitoring and Simulation, Ministry of Natural Resources, China [KF-2020-05-068].","","MDPI","20763417","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139954092"

A precise estimate of consumer delivery requests has to involve sequential factors such as shopping behaviors, weather conditions, events, business campaigns, and their couplings. Despite that various methods have integrated external features to enhance the effects, extant works fail to address complex feature-sequence couplings in the following aspects: weaken the inter-dependencies when processing heterogeneous data and ignore the cumulative and evolving situation of coupling relationships. To address these issues, we propose DeepExpress - a deep-learning-based express delivery sequence prediction model, which extends the classic seq2seq framework to learn feature-sequence couplings. DeepExpress leverages an express delivery seq2seq learning, a carefully designed heterogeneous feature representation, and a novel joint training attention mechanism to adaptively handle heterogeneity issues and capture feature-sequence couplings for accurate prediction. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms both shallow and deep baseline models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","express delivery; feature-sequence coupling; heterogeneous data; Sequence prediction","Consumer behavior; Data handling; Data mining; Deep learning; Forecasting; Business logistics; Customer experience; Express delivery; Feature sequence; Feature-sequence coupling; Heterogeneous data; Online business; Resource allocation optimization; Sequence models; Sequence prediction; Couplings","This work was partially supported by the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (Grant No. 62025205), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 62032020, No. 61725205, and No. 62002292)","","Association for Computing Machinery","21576904; 21576912","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146441113"

Despite the technical traits of cutting-edge science, it is difficult to detect abnormal events in the surveillance video and requires exhaustive human efforts. Anomalous events in the video remain a challenge due to the occlusions of objects, different densities of the crowd, cluttered backgrounds & objects, and movements in complex scenes and situations. In this paper, we propose a new model called time distributed convolutional neural network long short-term memory Spatiotemporal Autoencoder (TDSTConvLSTM), which uses a deep neural network to automatically learn video interpretation. Convolution neural network is used to extract visual features from spatial and time distributed LSTM use for sequence learning in temporal dimensions. Since most anomaly detection data sets are restricted to appearance anomalies or unusual motion. There are some anomaly detection data-sets available such as the UCSD Pedestrian dataset, CUHK Avenue, Subway entry-exit, ShanghaiTech, street scene, UCF-crime, etc. with varieties of anomaly classes. To narrow down the variations, this system can detect cyclists, bikers, skaters, cars, trucks, tempo, tractors, wheelchairs, and walkers who are walking on loan (off the road) which are visible under normal conditions and have a great impact on the safety of pedestrians. The Time distributed ConvLSTM has been trained with a normal video frame sequence belonging to these mentioned classes. The experiments are performed on the mentioned architecture and with benchmark data sets UCSD PED1, UCSD PED2, CUHK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech. The Pattern to catch anomalies from video involves the extraction of both spatial and temporal features. The growing interest in deep learning approaches to video surveillance raises concerns about the accuracy and efficiency of neural networks. The time distributed ConvLSTM model is good compared to benchmark models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anomaly detection; Deep Learning; Distributed convolutional neural network; long short-term memory; Machine Learning; Predictive ConvolutionLSTM; Smart Video Monitoring; Spatiotemporal Autoencoder; TDSTConvLSTM; Video Surveillance","","","","Gnedenko Forum","19322321","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141315567"

With the rise of GeoAI research, many high-quality urban observation datasets and deep learning models have emerged. However, geospatial heterogeneity makes these resources challenging to share and migrate to new application scenarios. This paper introduces vision language and semantic pre-trained model for street view image analysis as an example. This bridges the boundaries of data formats under location coupling, allowing for the acquisition of text-image urban scene objective descriptions in the physical space from the human perspective, including entities, entity attributes, and the relationships between entities. Besides, we proposed the SFT-BERT model to extract text feature sets of 10 urban land use categories from 8,923 scenes in Wuhan. The results show that our method outperforms seven baseline models, including computer vision, and improves 15% compared to traditional deep learning methods, demonstrating the potential of a pre-train & fine-tune paradigm for GIS spatial analysis. Our model could also be reused in other cities, and more accurate image descriptions and scene judgments could be obtained by inputting street view images from different angles.

These methods rely on historical labeled data and cannot accurately predict events when data are limited or of poor quality. Studying causal effects between events goes beyond correlation analysis and can contribute to a more robust prediction of events. However, incorporating causality analysis in data-driven event forecasting is challenging due to several factors: (i) Events occur in a complex and dynamic social environment. Many unobserved variables, i.e., hidden confounders, affect both potential causes and outcomes. (ii) Given spatiotemporal non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, modeling hidden confounders for accurate causal effect estimation is not trivial. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework that integrates causal effect estimation into event forecasting. We first study the problem of Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) estimation from observational event data with spatiotemporal attributes and present a novel causal inference model to estimate ITEs. We then incorporate the learned event-related causal information into event prediction as prior knowledge. Two robust learning modules, including a feature reweighting module and an approximate constraint loss, are introduced to enable prior knowledge injection. We evaluate the proposed causal inference model on real-world event datasets and validate the effectiveness of proposed robust learning modules in event prediction by feeding learned causal information into different deep learning methods. Experimental results demonstrate the strengths of the proposed causal inference model for ITE estimation in societal events and showcase the beneficial properties of robust learning modules in societal event forecasting. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","causal inference; event forecasting; representation learning","Deep learning; Learning systems; Causal inferences; Confounder; Data driven; Event forecasting; Event prediction; Inference models; Learning modules; Representation learning; Robust learning; Treatment effects; Forecasting","This work is supported in part by the US National Science Foundation under grants 1948432 and 2047843.","","Association for Computing Machinery","","9781450393850","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137141893"

Catalysed by the increasingly abundant spatial big data, Urban Geography seeks new models and research paradigms to explain urban phenomena and address urban issues. Recent years have witnessed significant advances in spatially-explicit geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), which integrates spatial studies and AI, primarily focusing on incorporating spatial thinking and concept into deep learning models for urban studies. This paper provides an overview of techniques and applications of spatially-explicit GeoAI in Urban Geography based on 581 papers identified using a systematic review approach. We examined and screened papers in three scopes of Urban Geography (Urban Dynamics, Social Differentiation of Urban Areas, and Social Sensing) and found that although GeoAI is a trending topic in geography and the applications of deep neural network-based methods are proliferating, the development of spatially-explicit GeoAI models is still at their early phase. We identified three challenges of existing models and advised future research direction towards developing multi-scale explainable spatially-explicit GeoAI. This review paper acquaints beginners with the basics of GeoAI and state-of-the-art and serve as an inspiration to attract more research in exploring the potential of spatially-explicit GeoAI in studying the socio-economic dimension of the city and urban life. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep learning; Graph neural network; Location encoder; Socio-economics; Urban studies","artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; GIS; machine learning; socioeconomic survey; spatial analysis; urban area; urban geography","Funding text 1: We thank the editor and 5 anonymous reviewers for their helpful and constructive comments and suggestions.

Mining valuable knowledge from spatio-temporal data is critically important to many real-world applications including human mobility understanding, smart transportation, urban planning, public safety, health care and environmental management. As the number, volume and resolution of spatio-temporal data increase rapidly, traditional data mining methods, especially statistics-based methods for dealing with such data are becoming overwhelmed. Recently deep learning models such as recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) have achieved remarkable success in many domains due to the powerful ability in automatic feature representation learning, and are also widely applied in various spatio-temporal data mining (STDM) tasks such as predictive learning, anomaly detection and classification. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of recent progress in applying deep learning techniques for STDM. We first categorize the spatio-temporal data into five different types, and then briefly introduce the deep learning models that are widely used in STDM.

Predicting such events and revealing the underlying triggering patterns are a crucial task for many applications, ranging from disease control to global politics. Traditional event prediction models based on Hawkes processes capture the spatio-temporal relationships between events, but cannot incorporate complex and heterogeneous external features, including population distribution, weather and terrain. This paper proposes an event prediction method that effectively utilizes the rich external information present in sets of unstructured data (e.g., map images, satellite images and weather map). Specifically, we extend a convolutional neural network (CNN) by combining it with continuous kernel convolution; and design the conditional intensity of Hawkes process based on the extended neural network model that accepts images as its input. Our approach of using the continuous convolution kernel provides a flexible way to discover the complex effect of external factors on the triggering process, as well as yielding tractable optimization algorithms. We use real-world event data from different domains (i.e., disease outbreaks, armed conflicts and protests) to demonstrate that the proposed method has better prediction performance than existing methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep learning; Event prediction; Hawkes process; Point process","Complex networks; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Forecasting; Armed conflict; Context-Aware; Data set; Disease outbreaks; Event prediction; Hawkes process; Point process; Spatiotemporal event; Temporal event datum; Disease control","","","Springer","15730565; 08856125","","MALEE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127164394"

GNNs first generate node embedding by aggregating neighboring information under different relations, and then use the final node embedding to detect the node's suspiciousness. However, traditional GNNs employing only a single type of aggregator fail to capture neighbor information from multiple perspectives and treating different relations equally inevitably weakens the semantic information of heterogeneous graphs. Meanwhile, expressive ability of GNNs is limited by using conventional concatenating or averaging operations to update the center node. Also, camouflaged entities could damage GNN-based models. To handle these problems, a novel heterogeneous GNN model called Multiple Aggregators and Feature Interactions Network (MAFI) is proposed in this paper to conduct fraud detection tasks. Concretely, multiple types of aggregators are applied on different relations to aggregate neighbor information and aggregator-level attention is utilized to learn the importance of different aggregators. Also, relation-level attention is leveraged to learn the importance of each relation. Besides, conventional update operations are replaced with vector-wise implicit and explicit feature interactions. Moreover, a trainable neighbor sampler is employed to filter camouflaged fraudsters. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world fraud datasets indicate that the proposed MAFI outperforms existing GNN-based fraud detectors. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","fraud detection; graph neural networks; Heterogeneous graph; trainable neighbor sampler","Aggregates; Big data; Crime; Graph neural networks; Semantics; Adaptation models; Feature interactions; Features extraction; Fraud detection; Heterogeneous graph; Interaction networks; Network-based; Task analysis; Trainable neighbor sampler; Feature extraction","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","23327790","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121387578"

Since nearby regions usually have similar socioeconomic characteristics which indicate similar crime patterns, recent state-of-the-art solutions constructed a distance-based region graph and utilized Graph Neural Network (GNN) techniques for crime forecasting, because the GNN techniques could effectively exploit the latent relationships between neighboring region nodes in the graph if the edges reveal high dependency or correlation. However, this distance-based pre-defined graph cannot fully capture crime correlation between regions that are far from each other but share similar crime patterns. Hence, to make a more accurate crime prediction, the main challenge is to learn a better graph that reveals the dependencies between regions in crime occurrences and meanwhile captures the temporal patterns from historical crime records. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end graph convolutional recurrent network called HAGEN with several novel designs for crime prediction. Specifically, our framework could jointly capture the crime correlation between regions and the temporal crime dynamics by combining an adaptive region graph learning module with the Diffusion Convolution Gated Recurrent Unit (DCGRU). Based on the homophily assumption of GNN (i.e., graph convolution works better where neighboring nodes share the same label), we propose a homophily-aware constraint to regularize the optimization of the region graph so that neighboring region nodes on the learned graph share similar crime patterns, thus fitting the mechanism of diffusion convolution. Empirical experiments and comprehensive analysis on two real-world datasets showcase the effectiveness of HAGEN. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Convolution; Forecasting; Graph neural networks; Graph theory; Distance-based; Forecasting problems; Homophily; Neighbourhood; Neural network techniques; Recent state; Recurrent networks; Socioeconomic characteristics; State of the art; Crime","This research has been funded in part by NSF grants CNS-2027794, CNS-2125530 and IIS-2128661, the USC Integrated Media Systems Center (IMSC), and an unrestricted cash gift from Google and Microsoft Research.

It is highly desirable to be able to anticipate the occurrence of such events in advance to reduce the potential social upheaval and damage caused. Event prediction, which has traditionally been prohibitively challenging, is now becoming a viable option in the big data era and is thus experiencing rapid growth, also thanks to advances in high performance computers and new Artificial Intelligence techniques. There is a large amount of existing work that focuses on addressing the challenges involved, including heterogeneous multi-faceted outputs, complex (e.g., spatial, temporal, and semantic) dependencies, and streaming data feeds. Due to the strong interdisciplinary nature of event prediction problems, most existing event prediction methods were initially designed to deal with specific application domains, though the techniques and evaluation procedures utilized are usually generalizable across different domains. However, it is imperative yet difficult to cross-reference the techniques across different domains, given the absence of a comprehensive literature survey for event prediction. This article aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive survey of the technologies, applications, and evaluations of event prediction in the big data era. First, systematic categorization and summary of existing techniques are presented, which facilitate domain experts' searches for suitable techniques and help model developers consolidate their research at the frontiers. Then, comprehensive categorization and summary of major application domains are provided to introduce wider applications to model developers to help them expand the impacts of their research. Evaluation metrics and procedures are summarized and standardized to unify the understanding of model performance among stakeholders, model developers, and domain experts in various application domains.

Extant studies established city-scale prediction models only based on buildings with energy data. However, building energy data in most cities is limited, which may impair model performance. A large number of unlabeled buildings (without energy data) may reveal important energy use knowledge, but few studies have explored their capability to improve building energy prediction. Therefore, a novel semi-supervised deep learning method, namely dynamically updated multi-fold semi-supervised learning method based on deep neural networks (DUMSL-DNN) is proposed to predict building energy use intensity (EUI) by utilizing unlabeled samples. Manhattan is selected as a case study, which contains 4854 labeled samples and 34,456 unlabeled samples. Compared with the optimal DNN model, DUMSL-DNN can improve building EUI prediction with root-mean-square error (RMSE) reduced by 9.36% and mean absolute error (MAE) reduced by 9.43%. The DUMSL method is superior to typical semi-supervised learning methods with the lowest RMSE of 0.5207 and the lowest MAE of 0.3325. By the implementation of DUMSL-DNN, more areas with high EUI are identified in Manhattan. Specifically, commercial buildings and residential buildings built before 1965 have higher EUI.

Therefore, anonymous proxy traffic detection is very essential for network security. In recent years, detection based on deep learning has become a hot research topic, since deep learning can automatically extract and select traffic features. To make (heterogeneous) network traffic adapt to the homogeneous input of typical deep learning algorithms, a major branch of existing studies convert network traffic into images for detection. However, such studies are commonly subject to the limitation of large-sized image representation of network traffic, resulting in very large storage and computational resource overhead. To address this limitation, a novel method for anonymous proxy traffic detection is proposed. The method is one of the solutions to reduce storage and computational resource overhead. Specifically, it converts the sequences of the size and inter-arrival time of the first N packets of a flow into images, and then categorizes the converted images using the one-dimensional convolutional neural network. Both proprietary and public datasets are used to validate the proposed method. The experimental results show that the converted images of the method are at least 90% smaller than that of existing image-based deep learning methods. With substantially smaller image sizes, the method can still achieve F1 scores up to 98.51% in Shadowsocks traffic detection and 99.8% in VPN traffic detection. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CNN; Shadowsocks traffic detection; spatio-temporal features; VPN traffic detection","Convolutional neural networks; Cybersecurity; Deep learning; Digital storage; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Network security; Virtual private networks; CNN; Computational resources; Detection methods; Network traffic; Shadowsock traffic detection; Spatiotemporal feature; Storage resources; Traffic detection; VPN traffic detection; Crime; algorithm; Algorithms; Neural Networks, Computer","Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61672026).","","MDPI","14248220","","","35684837","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131097419"

Crime prediction which aims at predicting crime incidents before they happen is of great importance to fight against crime. Previous studies are concerned primarily with day-level crime prediction and have certain limitations on modeling complex spatial–temporal-categorical dependency contained in the criminal activities as well as utilizing external factors to facilitate the forecast. In this paper, we develop a novel Neural Attentive framework for Hour-level Crime prediction (NAHC) to cope with these challenges. Specifically, we first adopt the priori knowledge-based data enhancement strategy to alleviate the zero-inflated issue raised in hour-level settings. Then, multi-graph convolutional networks are applied to capture spatial dependency from different aspects. After that, we integrate gated recurrent units with a temporal attention mechanism to jointly address temporal dependency and capture time-sensitive external factors. A categorical attention mechanism is proposed for dealing with categorical dependency and finally a fully connected network is utilized to generate the final prediction results.

The interaction of nodes between layers makes the attack effect on multiplex networks not simply a linear superposition of the attack effect on single-layer networks, and the disintegration of multiplex networks has become a research hotspot and difficult. Traditional multiplex network disintegration methods generally adopt approximate and heuristic strategies. However, these two methods have a number of drawbacks and fail to meet our requirements in terms of effectiveness and timeliness. In this paper, we develop a novel deep learning framework, called MINER (Multiplex network disintegration strategy Inference based on deep NEtwork Representation learning), which transforms the disintegration strategy inference of multiplex networks into the encoding and decoding process based on deep network representation learning. In the encoding process, the attention mechanism encodes the coupling relationship of corresponding nodes between layers, and reinforcement learning is adopted to evaluate the disintegration action in the decoding process. Experiments indicate that the trained MINER model can be directly transferred and applied to the disintegration of multiplex networks with different scales. We extend it to scenarios that consider node attack cost constraints and also achieve excellent performance. This framework provides a new way to understand and employ multiplex networks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","article; attention; deep learning; feature learning (machine learning); human; learning; miner; reinforcement (psychology); timeliness","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation (NNSF) of China under Grant Nos. 61603406 and 61403411 and the Scientific Research Plan of the National University of Defense Technology under Grant No. ZK-20-38.

The synergy between AI and big data has become imperative considering the drastic growth in personal data stemming from diverse sources (cloud computing, IoT, social networks, etc.). However, when data meet AI at some central place, it invites unimaginable privacy issues, and one of those issues is group privacy. Despite being the most significant problem, group privacy has not yet received the attention of the research community it is due. Problem Statement: We study how to preserve the privacy of particular groups (a community of people with some common attributes/properties) rather than an individual in personal data handling (i.e., sharing, aggregating, and/or performing analytics, etc.), especially when we talk about groups purposely made by two or more people (with clear group identifying markers), for whom we need to protect their privacy as a group. Aims/Objectives: With this technical letter, our aim is to introduce a new dimension of privacy (e.g., group privacy) from technical perspectives to the research community. The main objective is to advocate the possibility of group privacy breaches when big data meet AI in real-world scenarios. Methodology: We set a hypothesis that group privacy (extracting group-level information) is a genuine problem, and can likely occur when AI-based techniques meet high dimensional and large-scale datasets. To prove our hypothesis, we conducted a substantial number of experiments on two real-world benchmark datasets using AI techniques. Based on the experimental analysis, we found that the likelihood of privacy breaches occurring at the group level by using AI techniques is very high when data are sufficiently large. Apart from that, we tested the parameter effect of AI techniques and found that some parameters’ combinations can help to extract more and fine-grained data about groups. Findings: Based on experimental analysis, we found that vulnerability of group privacy can likely increase with the data size and capacity of the AI method. We found that some attributes of people can act as catalysts in compromising group privacy. We suggest that group privacy should also be given due attention as individual privacy is, and robust tools are imperative to restrict implications (i.e., biased decision making, denial of accommodation, hate speech, etc.) of group privacy. Significance of results: The obtained results are the first step towards responsible data science, and can pave the way to understanding the phenomenon of group privacy. Furthermore, the results contribute towards the protection of motives/goals/practices of minor communities in any society. Concluding statement: Due to the significant rise in digitation, privacy issues are mutating themselves. Hence, it is vital to quickly pinpoint emerging privacy threats and suggest practical remedies for them in order to mitigate their consequences on human beings. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","analytics; artificial intelligence; big data; clustering; data mining; differential privacy; group privacy; privacy-preserving data publishing; social network; utility","","Funding: This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (2020R1A2B5B01002145).","","MDPI","20799292","","","","English","Note","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129157161"

Although notable research efforts have been dedicated to classifying darknet traffic by combining machine learning algorithms and elaborately designed features, current methods either heavily depend on hand-crafted features or overlook the global intrinsic relationships among the local features automatically extracted from different data positions, leading to limited classification performance. To tackle this issue, we propose DarknetSec, a novel self-attentive deep learning method for darknet traffic classification and application identification. Concretely, DarknetSec utilizes a cascaded model with a 1-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) and a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network to capture local spatial-temporal features from the payload content of packets, while the self-attention mechanism is integrated into the abovementioned feature extraction network to mine the intrinsic relationships and hidden connections among the previously extracted content features. In addition, DarknetSec extracts side-channel features from payload statistics to enhance its classification performance. We evaluate DarknetSec on the CICDarknet2020 dataset, which is a representative of darknet traffic covering both Virtual Private Network (VPN) and The Onion Router (Tor) applications. Thorough experiments show that DarknetSec is superior to other state-of-the-art methods, achieving a multiclass accuracy of 92.22% and a macro-F1-score of 92.10%. Additionally, DarknetSec maintains its high accuracy when applied to other encrypted traffic classification tasks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification; Convolutional neural network; Darknet traffic; Long short-term memory; Self-attention mechanism; Spatial-temporal features","Brain; Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Learning algorithms; Virtual private networks; Application identification; Attention mechanisms; Classification identification; Convolutional neural network; Darknet traffic; Darknets; Learning methods; Self-attention mechanism; Spatial-temporal features; Traffic classification; Long short-term memory","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program China (2018YFB0803 503), the 2018 joint Research Foundation of Ministry of Education, China Mobile (MCM20180507) and the Opening Project of Shanghai Trusted Industrial Control Platform (TICPSH202003020-ZC).","","Elsevier Ltd","01674048","","CPSED","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125272427"

With people's growing needs and the rapid dynamics in a city environment, simply using a single travel demand for prediction may be insufficient. Alternatively, modeling multiple travel demands simultaneously can deepen our understanding toward the status of these potentially correlated demands and deploy the transportation in the city better. An important observation in this work is that multiple travel demands in a city often show common patterns, referred to as the shared mobility-aware knowledge. In addition, there are also unique patterns that characterize individual travel demand resulting in unique knowledge. To better leverage the shared and unique knowledge, we propose a novel framework (MultiST) to predict multiple spatialoral sequences (multiple travel demands) via two components that extract the shared and unique spatialoral dependencies, respectively. For the unique component, we use convolutional neural networks and gated recurrent units to embed unique knowledge. For the shared component, we design a recurrent Gaussian cell to extract temporal dependencies. Empirical results show that MultiST outperforms six state-of-the-art baseline methods and three variants of MultiST. We further visualize the temporal dependencies of the shared knowledge and discuss the practical implications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gaussian model; Multiple urban demands; Shared knowledge; Spatial - temporal prediction","Data mining; Forecasting; Internet of things; Knowledge management; Recurrent neural networks; Urban growth; Urban transportation; Features extraction; Gaussian model.; Gaussian modeling; Market researches; Multiple urban demand; Public transportation; Spatial temporals; Spatial-temporal prediction; Temporal prediction; Urban areas; Market Research","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2018YFB2100800; in part by the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars under Grant 62025205; and in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61772428, Grant 61725205, and Grant 62032020.","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","23274662","9781728176055","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115795580"

Different from previous works that usually deal with the problem in a multiple-instance learning manner, we formulate it as a fully-supervised learning task with label noises. Under this new perspective, we can fully leverage the advantages of well-designed action classifiers for anomaly detection as long as the label noises are cleaned. For this purpose, we devise a graph convolutional network for label noise cleaning, which integrates two crucial characteristics for anomaly analysis: feature similarity and temporal consistency. Supervised by both direct and indirect signals, the net propagates supervision information from high-confidence snippets to low-confidence ones and provides cleaned labels for action classifier training. In this way, we design an alternate learning strategy to progressively promote the discrimination of the action classifier. During the test phase, we directly utilize the learned action classifier for anomaly detection in an end-to-end fashion without any intermediate processing. We have conducted extensive experiments on various anomaly datasets of three scales with two main types of action classifiers, and achieved superior or comparable performances compared with state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we manually annotate the temporal duration of anomalies in the training data of UCF-Crime, and give out the upper-limit performance of our cleaner net. The annotation can also be used as the ground truth for studying anomaly detection models under multi-level supervisory signals, which will mitigate the present shortage of large-scale anomaly datasets. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anomaly detection; Graph convolutional networks; Learning with noise labels; Video action detection; Weakly-supervised learning","Classification (of information); Cleaning; Convolution; Graphic methods; Large dataset; Security systems; Supervised learning; Action classifier; Anomaly detection; Convolutional networks; Graph convolutional network; Learning with noise label; Multiple-instance learning; Performance; Video action detection; Video surveillance; Weakly supervised learning; article; classifier; cleaning; crime; learning; noise; outlier detection; video surveillance","","","Elsevier B.V.","18728286; 09252312","","NRCGE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123942552"

We consider the problem of mining serial episodes, sequential patterns allowing for gaps, from X that reliably predict those interesting events. With reliable we mean patterns that not only predict that an interesting event is likely to follow, but in particular that we can also accurately tell how how long until that event will happen. In other words, we are specifically interested in patterns with a highly skewed distribution of delays between pattern occurrences and predicted events. As it is unlikely that a single pattern can explain a complex real-world progress, we are after the smallest, least redundant set of such patterns that together explain the interesting events well. We formally define this problem in terms of the Minimum Description Length principle, by which we identify the best patterns as those that describe the occurrences of interesting events Y most succinctly given the data over X. As neither discovering the optimal explanation of Y given a set of patterns, nor the discovery of optimal pattern set are problems that allow for straightforward optimization, we break the problem in two and propose effective heuristics for both.

Therefore, the complex entangled dynamics of space and time need to be considered. This task is an essential but crucial loop in future smart cities construction, which can be widely applied in urban traffic management, disaster monitoring and mobility analysis. In recent years, video-like spatial–temporal modelling has been the most common approach in many deep learning models. However, the video-like modelling approach cannot consider some latent region-wise correlations other than geographic spatial distance information. To overcome the limitation, we propose a novel neural network framework, Adaptive Dual-View WaveNet (ADVW-Net), for the urban spatial–temporal event prediction. By integrating the spatial representations from Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and that from adaptive Graph convolutional neural network (GCN), our proposed model can capture not only the geographic correlations but also some latent region-wise dependencies from the input data. In addition, the effective architecture, WaveNet, can be transferred to region-wise spatial–temporal prediction scenarios for long-range temporal dependencies learning.

To promote the intelligent transformation from reactive to proactive policing, this study proposed a hierarchical crime prediction framework. First, the temporal dependency in the frequency domain was decomposed and a network constructed to capture the spatial relationships within the sub-frequencies. Human mobility in a city was then utilized to characterize the dynamic relationships within the network. Using the proposed framework, this study examined the crime distribution evolution in Chicago to holistically predict the short-term crimes in the different communities. The framework was found to have high predictive accuracy and significant potential in promoting proactive policing. It was concluded that: (1) as the crime distribution evolution comes from the spatial relationship changes, these dynamic relationships are critical in explaining and characterizing the evolution; and (2) the social interactions constructed using the human activity data can characterize the dynamic crime distribution relationships. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crime distribution; Graph neural network; Spatiotemporal framework; Urban crime","Forecasting; Frequency domain analysis; Graph neural networks; 'current; Crime distribution; Frequency domains; Human mobility; Intelligent transformations; Property; Spatial relationships; Spatiotemporal framework; Urban crime; Crime","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation (NSFC) Programs of China [ 72011540408 , 71722014 , and 71731009 ] and the National Research Foundation of Korea ( NRF-2020K2A9A2A06069972 ).

This development has been due to physicists venturing outside of their traditional domains of interest, but also due to scientists from other disciplines taking from physics the methods that have proven so successful throughout the 19th and the 20th century. Here we characterise the field with the term ‘social physics’ and pay our respect to intellectual mavericks who nurtured it to maturity. We do so by reviewing the current state of the art. Starting with a set of topics that are at the heart of modern human societies, we review research dedicated to urban development and traffic, the functioning of financial markets, cooperation as the basis for our evolutionary success, the structure of social networks, and the integration of intelligent machines into these networks. We then shift our attention to a set of topics that explore potential threats to society. These include criminal behaviour, large-scale migration, epidemics, environmental challenges, and climate change. We end the coverage of each topic with promising directions for future research. Based on this, we conclude that the future for social physics is bright. Physicists studying societal phenomena are no longer a curiosity, but rather a force to be reckoned with. Notwithstanding, it remains of the utmost importance that we continue to foster constructive dialogue and mutual respect at the interfaces of different scientific disciplines. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Human behaviour; Multidisciplinarity; Statistical physics; Sustainability; Thermodynamics","","We are thankful to Sheikh Taslim Ali, Yosef Ashkenazy, Simon Cauchemez, Xiaosong Chen, Benjamin J.

Accurate urban hotspots prediction can improve the efficiency of urban planning and security construction. Existing deep learning methods mainly adopt geographic grid maps, provided urban network, or external data to capture spatiotemporal dynamics. However, we observe that mining some latent self-semantics from raw data and fusing them with geospatial based grid images can also improve the performance of spatiotemporal predictions. In this paper, we propose Geographic-Semantic Ensemble Neural Network (GSEN), a novel deep learning approach, to stack geographical prediction neural network and semantical prediction neutral network. GSEN model integrates the structures of Predictive Recurrent Neural Network (PredRNN), Graph Convolutional Predictive Recurrent Neural Network (GC-PredRNN), and Ensemble Layer to capture spatiotemporal dynamics from different views. Furthermore, this model can also be correlated with some latent high-level dynamics in the real-world without any external data. We evaluate our proposed model on three different real-world datasets.

Technologies that assist people in independent living are essential for enhancing care in a cost-effective and reliable manner. Assisted care applications often demand real-time observation of the environment and the resident’s activities using an event-driven system. As an emerging area of research and development, it is necessary to explore the approaches of the user care system in the literature to identify current practices for future research directions. Therefore, this book is aimed at a comprehensive review of data sources (e.g., sensors) with machine learning for various smart user care systems. To encourage the readers in the field, insights of practical essence of different machine learning algorithms with sensor data (e.g., publicly available datasets) are also discussed. Some code segments are also included to motivate the researchers of the related fields to practically implement the features and machine learning techniques. It is an effort to obtain knowledge of different types of sensor-based user monitoring technologies in-home environments. With the aim of adopting these technologies, research works, and their outcomes are reported. Besides, up to date references are included for the user monitoring technologies with the aim of facilitating independent living. Research that is related to the use of user monitoring technologies in assisted living is very widespread, but it is still consists mostly of limited-scale studies. Hence, user monitoring technology is a very promising field, especially for long-term care. However, monitoring of the users for smart assisted technologies should be taken to the next level with more detailed studies that evaluate and demonstrate their potential to contribute to prolonging the independent living of people. The target of this book is to contribute towards that direction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","assisted living applications; data; human centered computing; machine learning; text based event; user interfaces","","","","Springer International Publishing","","9783031115332; 9783031115349","","","English","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166112050"

Consequently, an effective and efficient automatic methodology to estimate the influence of the misinformation on user beliefs and activities is needed. However, existing works on misinformation impact estimation either rely on small-scale psychological experiments or can only discover the correlation between user behaviour and misinformation. To address these issues, in this paper, we build up a causal framework that model the causal effect of misinformation from the perspective of temporal point process. To adapt the large-scale data, we design an efficient yet precise way to estimate the Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) via neural temporal point process and gaussian mixture models. Extensive experiments on synthetic dataset verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our model. We further apply our model on a real-world dataset of social media posts and engagements about COVID-19 vaccines. The experimental results indicate that our model recognized identifiable causal effect of misinformation that hurts people's subjective emotions toward the vaccines. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Behavioral research; COVID-19; Social networking (online); Causal influences; Counterfactuals; Large scale data; Point process; Psychological experiment; Public opinions; Small scale; Social media; Treatment effects; User behaviors; Vaccines","This work is supported by NSF Research Grant IIS-2226087.

Its harmful impact directly affects families and communities. To assist policymakers in mitigating this crisis, it is crucial to study the societal, economic, and criminal contributing factors linked to the crisis. Unfortunately, current data-driven works assume a singular factor, such as poverty being the cause and disregarding other realistic causes. Besides, recent works exhibited a lack of explainable models and spatial analysis of the crisis. Thus, DOD-Explainer links the gap by developing a realistic framework that predicts highly impacted counties of drug overdose deaths from crime and socioeconomic data. DOD-Explainer overcomes the challenge of data scarcity by proposing three data augmentation methods. Then, an algorithm is proposed to provide realistic explanations of the leading causes of the crisis. The results show that our application achieves the best predictive accuracy from several models, accurately identifies the most/least impacted counties by the crisis, and reveals the most contributing factors of drug overdoses. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","crime; data augmentation; Drug overdose deaths; explainability; prediction; socioeconomic; spatial analysis","Spatial variables measurement; Contributing factor; Crime data; Current data; Data augmentation; Drug overdose death; Explainability; Policy makers; Socio-economic data; Socio-economics; Spatial analysis; Crime","This research is supported in part by National Science Foundation grants CNS-2141095.

Prior work focuses on correlational analysis and ignores the importance of causal relationships behind events. Understanding the causality of events helps one infer future events by pinpointing potential triggers. In light of complex and dynamic social environments, it is difficult to comprehensively analyze the causes of societal events. In this work, we study the causal relationship between topics and events where topics are extracted from event-related documents. These topics represent probability distributions of words. We introduce a method to discover topics that have a causal effect on future events of interest. Next, we propose a causality-enhanced dynamic heterogeneous graph learning framework where topics, documents, and words are represented as nodes with changing edges. To handle the temporal dependencies of dynamic graphs, we introduce a temporal information learning module that updates node representations based on their evolving context and heterogeneous semantics. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in societal event prediction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Causality; Event Forecasting; Heterogeneous Graph Learning","Graph theory; Probability distributions; Semantics; Causal relationships; Causality; Correlational analysis; Data-driven model; Distributions of words; Event forecasting; Heterogeneous graph; Heterogeneous graph learning; Probability: distributions; Social environment; Forecasting","This work is supported in part by the US National Science Foundation under grants 1948432 and 2047843.","Zhu, X.; Ranka, S.; Thai, My.T.; Washio, T.; Wu, X.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15504786","9780769527024; 9781665450997; 0769530192; 0769517544; 9781665423984; 9780769530192; 9780769530185; 0769527019; 9781728183169; 9780769542560","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147731952"

Challenges of crime prediction can be divided into two equally vital parts: i) the prevention of crime before they take place; ii) the timely reduction and termination of harms after the appearance of victims. This paper manages to tackle the second problem by predicting both the latitude and the longitude of crime scene with data of crime in Los Angeles from 2020 to present. This article starts from scratch by using several classical models of ML (Linear Regression, LinearSVR and DecisionTree) to perform crime scene prediction. Additionally, Mean Squared Error (MSE) is selected as the criteria to judge the efficiency and accuracy of different models during comparison on this problem. This paper hopes to provide a prospect to call attention to more research and study on 'after-case-prediction' rather than simply focus on forecasts before assaults.

Prediction of these anomalies in the early stages is critical for public safety and mitigation of economic losses. However, predicting urban anomalies has various challenges like complex spatio-temporal relationships, dynamic nature, and data sparsity. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end deep learning based framework, i.e., UApredictor that utilizes stacked spatial-temporal-interaction block to predict urban anomaly from multivariate time-series data. We model the problem using an attribute graph, where we represent city regions as nodes to capture inter region spatial information using a spatial transformer. Further, to capture temporal correlation, we utilize a temporal transformer, and the interaction module retains complex interaction between spatio-temporal dimensions. Besides, the attention layer is added on the top of the spatial-temporal-interaction block that captures important information for predicting urban anomaly. We use real-world NYC-Urban Anomaly, NYC-Taxi, NYC-POI, NYC-Road Network, NYC-Demographic, and NYC-Weather datasets of New York city to evaluate the urban anomaly prediction framework. The results show that our proposed framework predicts better in terms of F-measure, macro-F1, and micro-F1 than baseline and state-of-the-art models. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","spatial temporal data; transformer; urban anomaly prediction","Complex networks; Deep learning; Forecasting; Losses; Taxicabs; Anomaly predictions; Economic loss; Illegal parking; Neural-networks; Public safety; Spatial temporals; Spatial-temporal data; Spatio-temporal relationships; Transformer; Urban anomaly prediction; Driveways","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","21614407; 21614393","9781509060146; 9780738133669; 9781728119854; 9781665488679; 9781457710865; 9798350359312; 9781728169262; 9781728186719; 9781509061815; 9781509006199","85OFA","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140784075"

In AGL-STAN, we design an adaptive graph learning method to learn the inter-dependencies among communities, and a time-aware self-attention method to accurately model the influence of time-varying crime incidents with a multi-head attention mechanism.

Accurate crime prediction results are vital for the beforehand decision-making of government to alleviate the increasing concern about the public safety. While many efforts have been devoted to proposing various spatial-temporal forecasting techniques to explore dependence across locations and time periods, most of them follow a supervised learning manner, which limits their spatial-temporal representation ability on sparse crime data. Inspired by the recent success in self-supervised learning, this work proposes a Spatial-Temporal Self-Supervised Hypergraph Learning framework (ST-HSL) to tackle the label scarcity issue in crime prediction. Specifically, we propose the cross-region hypergraph structure learning to encode region-wise crime dependency under the entire urban space. Furthermore, we design the dual-stage self-supervised learning paradigm, to not only jointly capture local- and global-level spatial-temporal crime patterns, but also supplement the sparse crime representation by augmenting region self-discrimination. We perform extensive experiments on two real-life crime datasets. Evaluation results show that our ST-HSL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis provides insights into the superiority of our ST-HSL method in the representation of spatial-temporal crime patterns.

The existing methods employ a stacked structure, which feeds captured topology information into a time series model. However, the structure introduces network noise that affects the accurate extraction of temporal features and reduces the prediction accuracy. Motivated by feature fusion methods in the Computer Vision (CV), we introduce a link prediction model based on attentional feature fusion (AFF-LP), which automatically extracts network features through Deep Learning. The proposed model leverages the self-attention mechanism to extract the topological and temporal features respectively. Moreover, the network features are fused based on a graph-level representation. With the help of a vector mapping model, the feature vectors are mapped to the future network topology. Three real opportunistic network datasets, ITC, MIT and Infocom06, are used for experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed model is more accurate and stable compared to other baseline methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","feature fusion; link prediction; Opportunistic network; self-attention","Deep learning; Extraction; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Hidden Markov models; Features extraction; Features fusions; Hidden-Markov models; Index; Link prediction; Network topology; Opportunistic network; Predictive models; Self-attention","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62062050, Grant 61962037, and Grant 61762065; in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Jiang Province under Grant 2020BABL202039; and in part by the Innovation Foundation for Postgraduate Student of Jiangxi Province under Grant YC2021S708.","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135223296"

These issues can have a significant impact on the quality of life of citizens. On-street parking systems have been designed to this end aiming at ensuring that parking spaces will be available for the local population, while also providing easy access to parking for people visiting the city center. However, these systems are often affected by illegal parking, providing incorrect information regarding the availability of parking spaces. Even though this can be mitigated using sensors for detecting the presence of cars in various parking sectors, the cost of these implementations is usually prohibiting large. In this paper, we investigate an indirect way of predicting parking violations at a fine-grained level, equipping such parking systems with a valuable tool for providing more accurate information to citizens. To this end, we employed a Deep Learning (DL)-based model to predict fine-grained parking violation rates for on-street parking systems. Moreover, we developed a data augmentation and smoothing technique for further improving the accuracy of DL models under the presence of missing and noisy data. We demonstrate, using experiments on real data collected in Thessaloniki, Greece, that the developed system can indeed provide accurate parking violation predictions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Crime; Deep learning; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; City centers; Fine grained; Illegal parking; Large cities; Local populations; On-street parking; Parking spaces; Parking violations; Quality of life; Street parking systems; Forecasting","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9781665478229","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135146918"

Traditional machine learning, anomaly detection, and other medical insurance fraud detection methods focus only on feature attributes, ignoring the rich behavioral attributes in the medical process. Considering the behavioral attributes, medical insurance fraud mainly comprises two domains: spatial and temporal, corresponding to gang fraud and individual anomaly, respectively. Therefore, this paper proposes a medical insurance fraud detection method utilizing a spatiotemporal constraint graph neural network (StGNN). Specifically, we first construct multiple medical insurance heterogeneous graphs based on the medical insurance dataset. Next, groups with the same behavioral trajectory are sampled using multi-semantic metapaths, while a two-layer attention mechanism assigns neighboring nodes and different behavioral trajectory weights. Then we use Bi-LSTM to detect individual anomalies during the patients’ treatment process. Finally, the proposed model is trained end-to-end, employing a cross-entropy loss function. Extensive experiments on two real datasets show that StGNN outperforms the existing methods on the anomaly detection task. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fraud Detection; Graph Neural Network; Medical Insurance; Spatiotemporal","Anomaly detection; Crime; Graph neural networks; Long short-term memory; Patient treatment; Semantics; Constraint graph; Detection methods; Fraud detection; Insurance frauds; Medical insurance; Spatio-temporal constraints; Spatiotemporal; Stable operation; Insurance","Funding text 1: Acknowledgment.

However, graph is non-Euclidean data, which leads to high computation and space cost while applying traditional methods. Graph embedding is an efficient method for graph analysis. It converts original graph data into a low-dimensional space and retains key information to improve the performance of downstream tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and node clustering. Different from previous studies, this paper focuses on both static and dynamic graph embedding. Firstly, this paper proposes a universal taxonomy of static and dynamic methods, including matrix factorization based methods, random walk based methods, autoencoder based methods, graph neural networks (GNN) based methods and other embedding methods.

Civil unrest, terrorist attacks and pandemics are commonly known events that can pose serious threats to both national security and public safety. Effectively predicting upcoming events is highly desirable in reality, as successful predictions can be of great use in designing countermeasures to prevent or reduce potential losses. Predicting events in advances plays an important role in public security, risk perception and infectious disease prevention and control, etc. Although event prediction used to be a technically challenging task, recent advances in the fields of big data analytics and machine learning have brought promising opportunities in applying these techniques to solve real world prediction problems. This paper presents a systematic survey on data-driven event prediction research studies. We first introduce the formal definition of event prediction problem and the evaluation metrics of various prediction techniques. Then, the state-of-the-art algorithms and schemes proposed in the field of event prediction are summarized and classified. All existing event prediction methods can be classified into 8 categories: frequent pattern mining, traditional classification model, time series model, temporal point processes, geospatial predictive modeling, event knowledge graph, unsupervised machine learning, multi-model fusion method. We present a systematic and comprehensive summary for each category of these methods. After that, we proceed by discussing the main real-world applications of event prediction techniques, including public security, disease prevention, smart city and natural disaster prediction. We conclude this survey by summarizing multiple open research problems and several possible directions on event prediction research.

This task aims to learn to localize video frames containing anomaly events with only binary video-level annotation, i.e., anomaly vs. normal. Traditional approaches usually formulate it as a multiple instance learning problem, which ignore the intrinsic data imbalance issue that positive samples are very scarce compared to negative ones. In this paper, we focus on addressing this issue to boost detection performance further. We develop a new light-weight anomaly detection model that fully utilizes enough normal videos to train a classifier with a good discriminative ability for normal videos, and we employ it to improve the selectivity for anomalous segments and filter out normal segments. Specifically, in addition to boosting anomalous prediction, a novel contrastive attention module additionally produces a converted normal feature from anomalous video to refined anomalous predictions by maximizing the classifier making a mistake. Moreover, to remove the stubborn normal segments selected by the attention module, we also design an attention consistency loss to employ the classifier with high confidence for normal features to guide the attention module. Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets, UCF-Crime, ShanghaiTech and XD-Violence, clearly demonstrate that our model largely improves frame-level AUC over the state-of-the-art.

The intellectual property (IP) of an outsourced design is now subject to IP piracy, which drives the need for a protection mechanism. Logic locking is a technique that aims to thwart IP piracy throughout the supply chain. However, state-of-the-art, provably secure logic locking (PSLL) techniques are vulnerable to functional and structural analysis-based attacks. Few removal attack protection mechanisms have been developed, such as diversified tree logic and wire entanglement, to protect PSLL against structural attacks. In this work, we significantly enhance GNNUnlock (GNNUnlock+) and demonstrate how the most advanced PSLL techniques armed with removal attack protection have no impact on its effectiveness. Our evaluation demonstrates that GNNUnlock+ is 89.66%-100% successful in breaking benchmarks locked using 9 different PSLL techniques-Stripped functionality logic locking, tenacious and traceless logic locking, Anti-SAT, SAT attack resistant logic locking (SARLock), Anti-SAT with diversified tree logic (Anti-SAT-DTL), Anti-SAT with wire entanglement, SARLock-DTL, corrupt and correct (CAC) and CAC-DTL. GNNUnlock+ can break the considered techniques under different parameters, synthesis settings, and technology nodes. Moreover, GNNUnlock+ successfully breaks corner cases where even the most advanced state-of-the-art attacks fail. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","graph neural networks; hardware security; IP protection; Logic locking; machine learning; oracle-less attacks","Crime; Internet protocols; Learning systems; Locks (fasteners); Machine learning; Network security; Supply chains; Graph neural network F; Graph neural networks; Intellectual property protection; Locking technique; Logic locking; Machine-learning; Oracle-less attack; Protection mechanisms; Provably secure; Secure logic; Forestry","","","IEEE Computer Society","21686750","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114726418"

The difficulty of travel time estimation is the impact of entangled spatial and temporal dynamics on real-time traffic conditions. However, most existing works does not fully exploit structured spatial information and temporal dynamics, resulting in low accuracy travel time estimation. To address the problem,we propose a novel spatial–temporal graph neural network framework, namely STGNN-TTE, for travel time estimation. Specifically, we adopt a spatial–temporal module to capture the real-time traffic conditions and a transformer layer to estimate the links’ travel time and the total routes’ travel time synchronously. In the spatial–temporal module, we present a multi-scale deep spatial–temporal graph convolutional network to capture the structured spatial–temporal dynamics. Also, in order to enhance the individual representation of each link, we adopt another transformer layer to extract the individualized long-term temporal dynamics. Finally, these two parts are integrated by a gating fusion module as the real-time traffic condition representation. We evaluate our model by sufficient experiments on three real-world trajectory datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our model is significantly superior to several existing methods. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Graph convolutional network; Spatial–temporal learning; Travel time estimation","Convolution; Dynamics; Intelligent systems; Traffic control; Transportation routes; Urban transportation; Graph convolutional network; Graph neural networks; Intelligent transportation systems; Real-time traffic conditions; Spatial temporals; Spatial–temporal learning; Temporal dynamics; Temporal graphs; Travel time estimation; Travel-time; Travel time","","","Elsevier B.V.","0167739X","","FGCSE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112278666"

Understanding these patterns may provide theoretical foundations for practical applications, such as travel demand prediction, passenger flow organization, land use planning, or incident management. Despite these merits, several issues are encountered in these applications, as big data have high-dimensional entities, various spatiotemporal dynamics, and complex mobility connections. These issues include expressing the patterns in a consistent way, detecting multiple outliers among them, portraying their inner complex correlations, modeling their spatiotemporal polymorphism, or visualizing them in an integrated manner. To deal with these complex characteristics, previous methods adopted in the era of small data have to be upgraded. Thus, we reviewed 3 747 academic studies published between 2010 and 2020 and explored the distributions of co-occurring hot keywords, topic variations, and publication preferences using a knowledge-mapping tool. A systematic summary was given to describe the progress made in five mobility-pattern-based research directions, namely normality analysis, abnormality analysis, correlation analysis, prediction analysis, and visual analytics. In particular, in the field of normality analysis, the progress of activity pattern analysis, travel category segmentation, and special group analysis was first reviewed. Based on the normality analysis, two types of approaches in the field of abnormality analysis were further summarized, namely module-based and data-driven approaches. With the knowledge of the ways identifying normal or abnormal behaviors, correlation analysis was further reviewed to determine the developing trends of detecting mobility correlations based on different data sources. All of the above research results serve as solid bases for prediction analysis of mobility patterns, which was also reviewed in this paper. The review results show that two main types of approaches are used to fulfill the task: statistics-based and data-driven estimations. Finally, previous studies on visual analytics were reviewed to determine how transportation data can be visualized based on user interaction, macro exploration, micro exploration, and overall exploration. Overall, we identified several potential challenges in the aforementioned research directions, and proposed three promising development trends in data integration, model innovation, and scheme revolution. Our ultimate aim is to provide potential guidance for future studies involving mobility pattern analysis based on new theories and technologies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Big data in transportation; Deep learning; Mobility pattern analysis; Review; Traffic engineering","Big data; Data integration; Deep learning; Forecasting; Highway engineering; Land use; Visualization; Big data in transportation; Correlation analysis; Human mobility; Mobility pattern; Mobility pattern analyse; Pattern analysis; Traffic Engineering; Travel behaviour; Visual analytics; Correlation methods","","","Chang'an University","10017372","","ZGXUF","","Chinese","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124558156"

Ltd., Guangzhou, China","As a critical task in intelligent traffic systems, traffic prediction has received a large amount of attention in the past few decades. The early efforts mainly model traffic prediction as the time-series mining problem, in which the spatial dependence has been largely ignored. As the rapid development of deep learning, some attempts have been made in modeling traffic prediction as the spatiooral data mining problem in a road network, in which deep learning techniques can be adopted for modeling the spatial and temporal dependencies simultaneously. Despite the success, the spatial and temporal dependencies are only modeled in a regionless network without considering the underlying hierarchical regional structure of the spatial nodes, which is an important structure naturally existing in the real-world road network. Apart from the challenge of modeling the spatial and temporal dependencies like the existing studies, the extra challenge caused by considering the hierarchical regional structure of the road network lies in simultaneously modeling the spatial and temporal dependencies between nodes and regions and the spatial and temporal dependencies between regions. To this end, this article proposes a new Temporal Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (TH-GAT). The main idea lies in augmenting the original road network into a region-augmented network, in which the hierarchical regional structure can be modeled. Based on the region-augmented network, the region-aware spatial dependence model and the region-aware temporal dependence model can be constructed, which are two main components of the proposed TH-GAT model. In addition, in the region-aware spatial dependence model, the graph attention network is adopted, in which the importance of a node to another node, of a node to a region, of a region to a node, and of a region to another region, can be captured automatically by means of the attention coefficients. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world traffic datasets, and the results have confirmed the superiority of the proposed TH-GAT model. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","gated recurrent unit; graph attention network; hierarchical; regional structure; Spatiooral; traffic prediction","Data mining; Deep learning; Graph theory; Learning systems; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Traffic control; Dependence model; Gated recurrent unit; Graph attention network; Hierarchical; Hierarchical graphs; Regional structure; Road network; Spatial dependence; Spatiooral; Traffic prediction; Forecasting","This project was supported by NSFC (62106079, 61876193, 61772233), Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (2020A1515110337), Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar (2016A030306014), Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Computational Science at the Sun Yat-sen University (2020B1212060032), and Open Foundation of Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Public Finance and Taxation with Big Data Application.","","Association for Computing Machinery","21576904; 21576912","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123960035"

Anomaly detection is applied in different forms in different application scenarios, such as network security, medical image and video monitoring. How to make full use of all kinds of characteristic information of data to identify the anomaly is one of the hot spots of anomaly detection. Many intelligent algorithms and models in data mining, machine learning and deep learning have been used to training anomaly detection rules to improve their detection performances. The training methods of anomaly detection rules are divided into three kinds: supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised methods, and the third kind is the most popular. Formally, unsupervised deep anomaly detection can be viewed as density estimation from the data distribution. At present, deep anomaly detection models have achieved remarkable results in different application scenarios. But these methods are mainly based on the original features of data for training, and ignore the complex correlation among data samples: there are usually some kinds of correlation among normal samples that abnormal samples do not have. This makes these methods not ideal for anomaly analysis of complex data with characteristics of large data size, high dimension, unbalanced abnormal proportion, etc. In view of this, in this paper, a sample-correlation-aware deep learning model is proposed and used for anomaly detection, named sample-correlation-aware unsupervised deep anomaly detection model(SCA-UDLM): First of all, through in-depth analysis of the original sample features and the correlation features among samples, the model uses the K-nearest neighbors algorithm to search for similar samples to extract the correlation features among samples and store them in an undigraph structure, where nodes represent the samples and the edges represent the correlation between the two samples. Secondly, the original features and correlation features are fused based on the dual autoencoder composed of feature encoder and graph encoder, and generated high-quality data embedding in the low-dimensional feature space. Thirdly, the decoder decodes the low-dimensional embedding into reconstruction samples with original dimensional, and calculates the reconstruction error and features. Finally, an estimation network based on Gaussian mixture model is designed to estimate the probability density of samples based on the input of the reconstruction features and the low-dimensional embedding which are fused by the additive fusion method, and judge whether these samples are abnormal or not based on the given judgment threshold. A large number of experiments and analyses were made on this model and relevant representative machine learning methods and up-to-date deep learning methods, such as, one class support vector machines (OC-SVM), isolation forests(IF), deep structured energy based models(DSEBM), deep autoencoding GMM(DAGMM), Anomaly generative adversarial network(AnoGAN), adversarially learned anomaly detection(ALAD). The experimental results show that the detection performances of this model are improved by about 2% compared with other related methods, and its experimental results with different parameters, modules and noises are more stable than other methods, which prove the validity of the correlation module. The visualization experimental results can also highlight the advantages of this model in data feature extraction and full utilization. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anomaly detection; Data correlation; Gaussian mixture model; Graph neural network","Anomaly detection; Complex networks; Data mining; Deep learning; Embeddings; Feature extraction; Gaussian distribution; Image segmentation; Medical imaging; Nearest neighbor search; Network security; Signal encoding; Anomaly detection models; Application scenario; Correlation features; Data correlations; Detection performance; Detection rules; Gaussian Mixture Model; Graph neural networks; Low dimensional embedding","decoder is designed for data reconstruction.

Here, we review the statistical, physical and artificial intelligence (AI) methods, data and model uncertainties, predictability and future directions for STF problems. Statistical STF methods have limitations in high-level feature extractions and long-term memory modeling. Physical models are computationally intensive and are imperfect in model structure and parameterization. AI models lack the interpretability and require elaborate training but can model complex nonlinear and non-Gaussian problems. Integrating data-driven and physical model-driven methods could facilitate the improvement of interpretability and forecasting accuracy. The predictive uncertainty comes from data and models, which could be measured by probability distribution and Bayesian inference, respectively. The predictive uncertainty is generally missing in AI models and could be resolved by incorporating Bayesian frameworks. The predictability of dynamic earth systems is spatiotemporally heterogeneous and is generally examined by diagnostic and prognostic approaches. Diagnostic methods analyze the predictability empirically from a theoretical perspective, while prognostic methods investigate the predictability through real experiments. Unraveling the predictability in space and time and the predictability sources will greatly improve earth system understanding and operational forecasting development. Current STF systems are largely not user-friendly to provide probabilistic and understandable forecasting services in near real-time.

However, such events are by nature rare and sparse, which causes the label imbalance problem and inferior performance of models relying on data sufficiency. The existing studies circumvent, instead of truly solving, this issue by defining the incident prediction problem in a coarse-grained temporal (e.g. daily) setting, which leaves the proposed models unrobust to fine-grained dynamics and trivial for the real-world decision making. In this paper, we tackle the temporally fine-grained incident prediction problem in a sparse setting by explicitly exploiting the behind-the-scene chainlike triggering mechanism. Moreover, this chain effect roots in multiple domains (i.e. spatial, categorical), which further entangles with the temporal dimension and happens to be time-variant. To be specific, we propose a novel deep learning framework, namely Spatiooral-Categorical Graph Neural Networks (STC-GNN), to handle the multidimensional and dynamic chain effect for performing fine-grained multi-incident co-prediction. Extensive experiments on three real-world city-level incident datasets verify the insightfulness of our perspective and effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","chain effect; data sparsity; emergency incidents; multi-graph convolutional recurrent neural networks; spatiooral prediction","Convolutional neural networks; Decision making; Emergency services; Fleet operations; Graph neural networks; Recurrent neural networks; Chain effect; Data sparsity; Emergency incident; Fine grained; Multi-graph convolutional recurrent neural network; Prediction problem; Real-world; Service provider; Spatiooral prediction; Forecasting","This work was partially supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant No. JP20K19859), JST Strategic International Collaborative Research Program (Grant No. JPMJSC2002), JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) (Grant No. 21K12042).","","Association for Computing Machinery","21550751","9781450309493; 9781595939913; 9781450324168; 9781581131468; 9781450324250; 9781605588100; 9781450309547; 9781450324137; 9781605588070; 9781450324212","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119179072"

However, anomaly event prediction is highly challenging due to the sparseness of data, geographic heterogeneity (e.g., complex spatial correlation, skewed spatial distribution of anomaly events and crowd flows), and the dynamic temporal dependencies. In this study, we propose M-STAP, a novel Multi-head Spatiooral Attention Prediction approach to address the problem of multi-region urban anomaly event prediction. Specifically, M-STAP considers the problem from three main aspects: (1) extracting the spatial characteristics of the anomaly events in different regions, and the spatial correlations between anomaly events and crowd flows; (2) modeling the impacts of crowd flow dynamic of the most relevant regions in each time step on the anomaly events; and (3) employing attention mechanism to analyze the varying impacts of the historical anomaly events on the predicted data. We have conducted extensive experimental studies on the crowd flows and anomaly events data of New York City, Melbourne and Chicago. Our proposed model shows higher accuracy (41.91% improvement on average) in predicting multi-region anomaly events compared with the state-of-the-arts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","anomaly event prediction; crowd flow; multi-head self-attention","Dynamics; Space time adaptive processing; Attention mechanisms; City management; Crowd flows; Event prediction; New York city; Spatial characteristics; Spatial correlations; State of the art; Forecasting","This project is supported, in part, by the University of Connecticut (UConn) Research Excellence Program (REP) Award (FY20–21 REP).","","Association for Computing Machinery","24749567","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115188515"

However, studies modeling occupant behaviors at the urban scale are still limited. Recent work has revealed that urban big data can enable occupant behavior modeling at the urban scale – however, utilizing the existing data sources and modeling methods in building science to model urban scale occupant behaviors can be quite challenging. Beyond building science, urban scale human behaviors have been studied in several different domains using more advanced modeling methods, including Stochastic Modeling, Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Network Modeling, etc. This paper aims to bridge the gap between data sources and modeling methodologies in building science by borrowing from other domains. Based on a comprehensive review, we 1) identify the modeling challenges of the current approaches in building science, 2) discuss the modeling requirements and data sources both in building science and other domains, 3) review the current modeling methods in building science and other domains, and 4) summarize available performance evaluation metrics for evaluating the modeling methods.

This topic has been gaining increasing significance, as virtually every country is experiencing an aging population, with generally higher level of vulnerability and demand for the emergency medical service (EMS). Although exploring the spatial and temporal correlations in EMS historical records, the existing methods principally consider the former time-invariant, which does not necessarily hold in reality. Moreover, this assumption ignores the fact that the behind-the-scenes dynamics are people, whose demographic profiles and activity patterns could be determinants of regional EMS demands. In this paper, we are therefore motivated to mine the collective daily routines in human mobility, to further represent the evolving spatial correlations. Particularly, we model profiled mobility groups as multiple random walkers and propose a novel bicomponent neural network, including a heterogeneous multi-graph convolution layer and spatio-temporal interlacing attention module, to perform the prediction task. Experimental results on the real-world data verify the effectiveness of introducing dynamic human mobility and the advantage of our approach over the state-of-the-art models. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ambulance Demand Prediction; Heterogeneous Multi-Graph Convolution; Profiled Human Mobility; Spatio-Temporal Attention","Ambulances; Convolution; Emergency services; Graph neural networks; Multilayer neural networks; Ambulance demand prediction; Demand prediction; Emergency medical services; Fleet allocation; Heterogeneous multi-graph convolution; Human mobility; Profiled human mobility; Spatio-temporal; Spatio-temporal attention; Forecasting","This work was partially supported by Grant-in-Aid for Early-Career Scientists (JP20280241, 19K20352) of Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) and the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).","","IEEE Computer Society","23750286; 10844627","9781424408030; 1424408032; 9781665408837; 9780769535456; 9781509065431; 9781479925544; 081860655X; 1424408326; 0769522858; 0769525709","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112864170"

In this study, we employ deep learning to recognize behavior based on body and hand–object interaction regions of interest (ROIs). We propose an ROI-based four-stream ensemble convolutional neural network (CNN). Behavior recognition data are mainly composed of images and skeletons. The first stream uses a pre-trained 2D-CNN by converting the 3D skeleton sequence into pose evolution images (PEIs). The second stream inputs the RGB video into the 3D-CNN to extract temporal and spatial features. The most important information in behavior recognition is identification of the person performing the action. Therefore, if the neural network is trained by removing ambient noise and placing the ROI on the person, feature analysis can be performed by focusing on the behavior itself rather than learning the entire region. Therefore, the third stream inputs the RGB video limited to the body-ROI into the 3D-CNN. The fourth stream inputs the RGB video limited to ROIs of hand–object interactions into the 3D-CNN. Finally, because better performance is expected by combining the information of the models trained with attention to these ROIs, better recognition will be possible through late fusion of the four stream scores. The Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI)-Activity3D dataset was used for the experiments. This dataset contains color images, images of skeletons, and depth images of 55 daily behaviors of 50 elderly and 50 young individuals. The experimental results showed that the proposed model improved recognition by at least 4.27% and up to 20.97% compared to other behavior recognition methods. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Behavior recognition; Convolutional neural network; Ensemble; RGB video; Skeleton","Behavioral research; Convolutional neural networks; Musculoskeletal system; Telecommunication industry; Behavior recognition; Context- awareness; Daily behaviors; Electronics and telecommunications research institutes; Feature analysis; Object interactions; Sports video analysis; Temporal and spatial; Deep learning","Funding text 1: Funding: This work was supported by the ICT R&D program of MSIT/IITP.

Law enforcement agencies have been utilizing it as a tool for intelligence gathering and criminal investigation for decades. However, the graph nature of social networks makes it highly restricted to intelligence analysis tasks, such as role prediction (node classification), social relation inference (link prediction), and criminal group discovery (community detection), etc. In the past few years, many studies have focused on Graph Neural Network (GNN), which utilizes deep learning methods to solve graph-related problems. However, we have rarely seen GNNs tackle time-evolving social network problems, especially in the criminology field. The existing studies have commonly over-looked the temporal-evolution characteristics of social networks. In this paper, we propose a graph neural network framework, namely Spatial-Temporal Graph Social Network (STGSN), which models social networks from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Using a novel approach, we leverage the temporal attention mechanism to capture social networks’ temporal features. We design a method analyzing temporal attention distribution to improve the interpretation ability of our method. In the end, we conduct extensive experiments on six public datasets to prove our methods’ effectiveness. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attention network; Criminal Network Analysis; Graph Neural Network; Social Network Analysis; Spatial–Temporal Graph Neural Network","Crime; Deep learning; Learning systems; Attention mechanisms; Community detection; Criminal investigation; Graph neural networks; Intelligence analysis; Intelligence gathering; Law-enforcement agencies; Temporal evolution; Neural networks","We thank the Sichuan Provincial Public Security Department experts, who provided insight and expertise that greatly assisted the research.

In the first stage, we build a large training set with ordinary people by comparing every two samples. After that, we train a Siamese Network with the paired comparison data set to get a score for each sample. In the second stage, we map the scores to evaluation grades with the help of experts.

While previous work has made significant efforts to learn traffic temporal dynamics and spatial dependencies, two key limitations exist in current models. First, only the neighboring spatial correlations among adjacent regions are considered in most existing methods, and the global inter-region dependency is ignored. Additionally, these methods fail to encode the complex traffic transition regularities exhibited with time-dependent and multi-resolution in nature. To tackle these challenges, we develop a new traffic prediction framework-Spatial-Temporal Graph Diffusion Network (ST-GDN). In particular, ST-GDN is a hierarchically structured graph neural architecture which learns not only the local region-wise geographical dependencies, but also the spatial semantics from a global perspective. Furthermore, a multi-scale attention network is developed to empower ST-GDN with the capability of capturing multi-level temporal dynamics. Experiments on several real-life traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-GDN outperforms different types of state-of-the-art baselines.

Existing crime prediction research mainly focus on inferring crime locations or criminal groups. However, the predicted crime locations or groups are too large to locate a specific person. Moreover, as individual offenders typically have no cooperative relationship with other offenders, it is difficult to apply existing methods on predicting crime groups for individual crime risk prediction. In this paper, we propose Fusion Information Graph Attention Networks (FIGAT), which predicts individual crime risks rather than crime locations or groups with personal daily movement trajectories. Experimental results with the dataset from a real-world public safety system show that FIGAT can accurately predict individual crime risks and is significantly better than other methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crime Prediction; Graph Neural Network; Spatial-temporal Trajectory","Crime; Graph neural networks; Location; Safety engineering; Cooperative relationships; Crime prediction; Multi-information fusion; Predicting crimes; Prediction research; Public safety; Spatial temporals; Spatial-temporal trajectory; Temporal trajectories; Forecasting","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9781665418157","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128725191"

Certainly, moving object data intended for location-based services is predominant, due to availability of spatiotemporal location data provided by current devices such as mobile devices, GPS devices, RFID and various sensors. This work examines the use of our trajectories meta-model given in previous works to detect and monitor frauds, from the point of view of trajectories semantic aspects. Modeling of frauds by trajectories gives meaning to the sequence of events that made it possible to detect them and to recognize the situations of their occurrence. The semantic dimension qualifies a fraud trajectory as a story that has both meaning and intention, described by episodes of semantic events related to the creation of the fraud, to its dynamic and to its ending. Fraud analytics will benefit from trajectory analytics for both big data ecosystems and spatiotemporal data mining algorithms and practices.

Its ability to accurately solve complex problems is employed in vision research to learn deep neural models for a variety of tasks, including security critical applications. However, it is now known that deep learning is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can manipulate its predictions by introducing visually imperceptible perturbations in images and videos. Since the discovery of this phenomenon in 2013, it has attracted significant attention of researchers from multiple sub-fields of machine intelligence. In 2018, we published the first-ever review of the contributions made by the computer vision community in adversarial attacks on deep learning (and their defenses). Many of those contributions have inspired new directions in this area, which has matured significantly since witnessing the first generation methods. Hence, as a legacy sequel of our first literature survey, this review article focuses on the advances in this area since 2018. We thoroughly discuss the first generation attacks and comprehensively cover the modern attacks and their defenses appearing in the prestigious sources of computer vision and machine learning research. Besides offering the most comprehensive literature review of adversarial attacks and defenses to date, the article also provides concise definitions of technical terminologies for the non-experts. Finally, it discusses challenges and future outlook of this direction based on the literature since the advent of this research direction. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adversarial defense; Adversarial examples; adversarial machine learning; black-box attack; deep learning; perturbation; white-box attack","Deep learning; Surveys; Adversarial defense; Adversarial example; Adversarial machine learning; Black boxes; Black-box attack; Complex problems; Perturbation; White box; White-box attack; Computer vision","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","21693536","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119405946"

Aiming at the problem of performance for abnormal event detection caused by these correlations, a video anomaly detection method based on space-time fusion graph network learning is proposed. In this method, spatial similarity graph and temporal trend graph for the segments are constructed in terms of the features of the segments. The spatial similarity graph is built dynamically by treating the features of the video segments as the vertexes in graph. In this graph, the weights of edges are dynamically formed by taking the relationship between vertex and its Top-k similarity vertexes into account. The temporal trend graph is built by taking the time distance for m sequential segments into account. The space-time fusion graph convolutional network is constructed by adaptively weighting the spatial similarity graph and temporal trend graph. The video embedding features are learnt and generated by using this graph convolutional network. A graph sparse regularization is added to the ranking loss, in order to reduce the over-smoothing effect of graph model and improve detection performance. The experiments are conducted on two challenging video datasets: UCF-Crime(University of Central Florida crime dataset) and ShanghaiTech. ROC(receiver operating characteristic curve) and AUC (area under curve) are taken as performance metrics. Our method obtains the AUC score of 80.76% rising by 5.35% compared with the baseline on UCF-Crime dataset, and also gets the score of 89.88% rising by 5.44% compared with SOTA(state of the art) weakly supervised algorithm on ShanghaiTech.

Due to the ubiquity of Internet connectivity and smart devices, social sensing is emerging as a dynamic AI-driven sensing paradigm to extract real-time observations from online users. In this paper, we propose CovidSens, a vision of social sensing-based risk alert systems to spontaneously obtain and analyze social data to infer the state of the COVID-19 propagation. CovidSens can actively help to keep the general public informed about the COVID-19 spread and identify risk-prone areas by inferring future propagation patterns. The CovidSens concept is motivated by three observations: (1) people have been actively sharing their state of health and experience of the COVID-19 via online social media, (2) official warning channels and news agencies are relatively slower than people reporting their observations and experiences about COVID-19 on social media, and (3) online users are frequently equipped with substantially capable mobile devices that are able to perform non-trivial on-device computation for data processing and analytics. We envision an unprecedented opportunity to leverage the posts generated by the ordinary people to build a real-time sensing and analytic system for gathering and circulating vital information of the COVID-19 propagation. Specifically, the vision of CovidSens attempts to answer the questions: How to distill reliable information about the COVID-19 with the coexistence of prevailing rumors and misinformation in the social media? How to inform the general public about the latest state of the spread timely and effectively, and alert them to remain prepared? How to leverage the computational power on the edge devices (e.g., smartphones, IoT devices, UAVs) to construct fully integrated edge-based social sensing platforms for rapid detection of the COVID-19 spread? In this vision paper, we discuss the roles of CovidSens and identify the potential challenges in developing reliable social sensing-based risk alert systems. We envision that approaches originating from multiple disciplines (e.g., AI, estimation theory, machine learning, constrained optimization) can be effective in addressing the challenges. Finally, we outline a few research directions for future work in CovidSens. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Disease tracking; Information distillation; Real-time; Social sensing","Aircraft detection; Computation theory; Constrained optimization; Data handling; Social networking (online); Computational power; Estimation theory; Internet connectivity; Multiple disciplines; Online social medias; Propagation pattern; Real time observation; Real time sensing; Data flow analysis","This research is supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos.

For implementing the GCLSTM, first a smoothing technique based on LOESS regression was used for denoising the number of theft events for day, then the smoothed series of the last 30 days was considered as the input of the GCLSTM neural network for predicting the number of thefts in the following day the results provided a better performance of the GCLSTM compared to a traditional LSTM, achieving an R2 of 0.86. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crime Prediction; Deep Learning; Graph Convolutional Long Short Term Memory","Convolution; Crime; Forecasting; Vehicles; Convolutional model; De-noising; Metropolitan regions; Motor vehicle; Santiago de Chile; Similar pattern; Smoothing techniques; Long short-term memory","","","IEEE Computer Society","15224902","9780769544007; 9781509004263; 9798350313895; 9781538634837; 9780769524917; 9781665409568; 9781509004218; 0769518672; 9781728183282; 9798331527891","","","Spanish","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098639915"

Effective urban planning can help to mitigate the operational and social vulnerability of a urban system, such as high tax, crimes, traffic congestion and accidents, pollution, depression, and anxiety. Due to the high complexity of urban systems, such tasks are mostly completed by professional planners. But, human planners take longer time. The recent advance of deep learning motivates us to ask: can machines learn at a human capability to automatically and quickly calculate land-use configuration, so human planners can finally adjust machine-generated plans for specific needs? To this end, we formulate the automated urban planning problem into a task of learning to configure land-uses, given the surrounding spatial contexts. To set up the task, we define a land-use configuration as a longitude-latitude-channel tensor, where each channel is a category of POIs and the value of an entry is the number of POIs. The objective is then to propose an adversarial learning framework that can automatically generate such tensor for an unplanned area. In particular, we first characterize the contexts of surrounding areas of an unplanned area by learning representations from spatial graphs using geographic and human mobility data. Second, we combine each unplanned area and its surrounding context representation as a tuple, and categorize all the tuples into positive (well-planned areas) and negative samples (poorly-planned areas). Third, we develop an adversarial land-use configuration approach, where the surrounding context representation is fed into a generator to generate a land-use configuration, and a discriminator learns to distinguish among positive and negative samples. Finally, we devise two new measurements to evaluate the quality of land-use configurations and present extensive experiment and visualization results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","generative adversarial networks; graph neural networks; representation learning; urban planning","Deep learning; Geographic information systems; Information systems; Information use; Motor transportation; Planning; Tensors; Traffic congestion; Urban planning; Adversarial learning; Context representation; Human capability; Negative samples; Planning problem; Quickly calculate; Social vulnerability; Visualization results; Land use","This research was partially supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) via the grant numbers: 1755946, I2040950, 2006889.","Lu, C.-T.; Wang, F.; Trajcevski, G.; Huang, Y.; Newsam, S.; Xiong, L.","Association for Computing Machinery","","9781450380195","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097296062"

However, its applications in video analytics is not deeply investigated yet. For instance, surveillance anomaly recognition is an open challenging problem and one of its hurdles is the lack of accurate temporally annotated data. This paper addresses the lack of data issue using one-shot learning strategy and proposes an anomaly recognition framework which exploits a 3D CNN siamese network that yields the similarity between two anomaly sequences. This paper also investigates the existing 3D CNNs for this task and then proposes a lightweight 3D CNN model that efficiently handles one-shot anomaly recognition. Once our network is trained, then we can use the powerful discriminative 3D CNN features to predict anomalies not only for the new data but also for entirely new classes. The proposed model is trained using temporally annotated test set of UCF Crime dataset. Finally, the trained model is used to recognize the anomalies and produce temporal automatic labels for the video level weakly annotated training set of the dataset. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","anomaly recognition; Artificial intelligence; convolutional neural network; deep learning; one-shot learning; siamese network","3D modeling; Image recognition; Statistical tests; Anomaly recognition; CNN models; ITS applications; One-shot learning; Test sets; Training sets; Video analytics; Vision communities; Neural networks","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning &Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (2019-0-00136, Development of AI-Convergence Technologies for Smart City Industry Productivity Innovation)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9780780390485; 9781509060146; 0780314212; 9781479914845; 9780738133669; 9781467314909; 9780780314214; 9781728119854; 0780390482; 9781665488679","85OFA","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093859224"

For anomalous action research, it is difficult to collect and make datasets due to the rare occurrence of anomalous actions. Therefore, the research on few-shot learning of action recognition has certain significance. Based on the above, this paper studies the few-shot learning of anomalous action recognition. We present an anomalous action recognition network based on few-shot learning. We clip the videos in UCF-Crime datasets and other videos collected on the network to make a new dataset named UCF-Crime+. The action recognition network pre-trained by kinetics named I3D is used to extract the feature of the anomalous action video. We use a few-shot learning network, named prototypical network to classify the video feature samples, so as to realize the few-shot learning and classification of the anomalous video. In order to increase the difference between clusters, we use the triplet loss function. At the same time, the feature fusion of I3D network is carried out, which increases the utilization and fusion of deep and shallow features. The experimental results show that the improved few-shot learning model has higher accuracy than the base network. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","action recognition; anomalous action; feature fusion; few-shot learning","Crime; Large dataset; Action recognition; Action research; Between clusters; Feature fusion; Learning models; Learning network; Number of samples; Video features; Learning systems","This work was supported by SJTU-SMARCHIT Joint Research Laboratory for Smart Building.","Xu, B.; Mou, K.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9781728143903","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086261608"

Captured contextual information for an event of interest can aid human analysts in understanding the factors associated with that event. However, capturing contextual information within event forecasting is challenging due to several factors: (i) uncertainty of context structure and formulation, (ii) high dimensional features, and (iii) adaptation of features over time. Recently, graph representations have demonstrated success in applications such as traffic forecasting, social influence prediction, and visual question answering systems. In this paper, we study graph representations in modeling social events to identify dynamic properties of event contexts as social indicators. Inspired by graph neural networks, we propose a novel graph convolutional network for predicting future events (e.g., civil unrest movements). We extract and learn graph representations from historical/prior event documents. By employing the hidden word graph features, our proposed model predicts the occurrence of future events and identifies sequences of dynamic graphs as event context. Experimental results on multiple real-world data sets show that the proposed method is competitive against various state-of-the-art methods for social event prediction. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network; Event Prediction; Temporal Encoding","Convolution; Data mining; Contextual information; Convolutional networks; Event prediction; Graph neural networks; Graph representation; High dimensional feature; Question answering systems; State-of-the-art methods; Forecasting","This material is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under Grant Award Number 2017-ST-061-CINA01.
